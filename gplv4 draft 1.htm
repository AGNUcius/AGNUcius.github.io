<br/>
&nbsp; <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers of physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es may withold <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom to <a href="use.htm">Use</a>, <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>ify, Copy and Share the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects of those <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public law.htm">General Public Law</a> is intended to guarantee your <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom to <a href="use.htm">Use</a>, <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>ify, Copy and Share <a href="free.htm">Free</a> <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects--to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e sure those <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects are <a href="free.htm">Free</a> for all <a href="user.htm">user</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;We, the Personal Sovereignty Foundation, <a href="use.htm">use</a> the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public law.htm">General Public Law</a> for most of our <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects; it applies also to any other <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect whose <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers commit to using it.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can apply it to your <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, too.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; When we speak of <a href="free.htm">Free</a> <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects or <a href="free.htm">Free</a> <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es, we are referring to <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom and <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our <a href="general public law.htm">General Public Law</a> is designed to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e sure that you have the <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom to <a href="use.htm">Use</a> the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>ify the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect or <a href="use.htm">use</a> pieces of it in <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="free.htm">Free</a> <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects, Copy the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, Share Copies of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, and that you <a href="know.htm">know</a> you can do these things.&nbsp;&nbsp;It also requires any <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e paid above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <small>(all <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> be an investment for that <a href="user.htm">user</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; To <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> your rights, we need to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e requirements that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you <a href="use.htm">Use</a>, <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>ify, Copy or Share the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; For example, if you Share such an <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect <small>(Almonds for instance)</small>, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.&nbsp;&nbsp;You must <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e sure that they, too, receive <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of that <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect <small>(<a href="land.htm">land</a>, tree, water, tools for instance)</small>, or in <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of that same type that are under this Law in the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> equal to the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e they <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> and the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s in<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ed for the last round of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.&nbsp;&nbsp;And you must show them these terms so they <a href="know.htm">know</a> their rights.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Developers that <a href="use.htm">use</a> the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> your rights in three steps: <small>(0)</small> Create or purchase physical <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects, <small>(1)</small> assert <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty Rights, Copyright and Patent claims on those <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects, <small>(2)</small> offer you this Law which gives you legal permission to <a href="use.htm">Use</a>, <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>ify, Copy and Share those <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; For the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers' <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ion, the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> clearly explains that there is no warranty for this <a href="free.htm">Free</a> <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect or any of it's <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>ed <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.&nbsp;&nbsp;For both <a href="user.htm">user</a>s' and <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers' sake, the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> requires that a <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, or adjustments to the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es that <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ifies the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect be marked and the Design Documents changed, so that their problems will not be associated erroneously with the original version.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Some <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects or their <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es are designed to deny <a href="user.htm">user</a>s access to fully <a href="use.htm">Use</a>, <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>ify, Copy or Share them.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>amentally incompatible with the purpose of the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>, which is to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> these <a href="free.htm">free</a>doms.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> ensures that the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects and <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es it covers will not be restricted in these ways.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Finally, every <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect is threatened constantly by patents and other claims of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership meant to extract royalties through <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>es should not allow these manufactured constraints to restrict development and <a href="use.htm">use</a> of <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects, but in places where they do, we wish to avoid the special danger that <a href="user.htm">user</a>s of <a href="free.htm">Free</a> <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects will individually obtain patents or pen legislation to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect or one of it's <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>rietary.&nbsp;&nbsp;To prevent this, the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> assures that <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty Rights, Copyrights, Patents, <a href="trad.htm">Trad</a>emarks, Treaties, <a href="agree.htm">Agree</a>ments, etc. cannot be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to render the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect or it's <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es non-<a href="free.htm">free</a>.<br/>

&nbsp; Our <a href="general public law.htm">General Public Law</a> is designed to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e sure that you have the <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom to <a href="use.htm">Use</a> the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>ify the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect or <a href="use.htm">use</a> pieces of it in <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="free.htm">Free</a> <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects, Copy the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, Share Copies of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, and that you <a href="know.htm">know</a> you can do these things.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; A <a href="part.htm">part</a>y's "essential patent claims" in an <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect are all patent claims that the <a href="part.htm">part</a>y can give permission to practice, whether already acquired or to be acquired, that would be infringed by Using, <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>ifying, Copying, or Sharing the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect or any of it's <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1. <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The "<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e" of a <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect means the exact pa<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>s of this <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect or the preferred forms <small>(such as the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hines, plants, tools, etc.)</small> for <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing copies of or <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ifications to the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The "Supporting <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es" of an <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect include every subunit such that <small>(a)</small> the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>ntical subunit is normally included as an adjunct in either a major essential component <small>(<a href="land.htm">land</a>, water, genetics and so on)</small> of the specific community <small>(if any)</small> in which the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect is <a href="use.htm">use</a>d, or a <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to create this <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, or a <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to interpret or otherwise operate this <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, and <small>(b)</small> the subunit <small>(aside from possible incidental extensions)</small> serves only to enable <a href="use.htm">use</a> of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect or to implement a widely <a href="use.htm">use</a>d or standard interface for which a roalty-<a href="free.htm">free</a> design is available to the public.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The "Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es" for an <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect means all the <a href="land.htm">land</a> and capital needed to generate, <a href="install.htm">install</a>, and <small>(for some <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects)</small> to operate and <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, except its Supporting <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es, and except general-purpose tools or generally available <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects which are <a href="use.htm">use</a>d unmodified in performing those activities but which are not <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es include robots <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to control those activities, interface specifications associated with the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, and the Design Documents for any Supporting <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e and dynamically utilized sub<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es that the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect is specifically designed to require, such as by complex material handling or control flow between those sub<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es and other <a href="part.htm">part</a>s of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e also includes any encryption or authorization <a href="key.htm">key</a>s necessary to <a href="install.htm">install</a> and/or execute <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified versions of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect in the recommended or principal context of <a href="use.htm">use</a>, such that they can implement all the same functionality in the same range of circumstances.&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>(For instance, if the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect is a physical DVD player and can play certain DVDs, it must be possible for <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified versions to play those DVDs.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect communicates with humans or with other <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, it must be possible for <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified versions to communicate with the same receivers in the same way such that the receiver cannot distinguish.)</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;A <a href="key.htm">key</a> need not be included in cases where <a href="use.htm">use</a> of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect normally implies the <a href="user.htm">user</a> already has the <a href="key.htm">key</a> and can read and copy it, as in privacy applications where <a href="user.htm">user</a>s generate their <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="key.htm">key</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the fact that a <a href="key.htm">key</a> is generated or is present in <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ware that limits its <a href="use.htm">use</a> does not alter the requirement to include it in the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e may include portions which do not formally <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e this Law as their Law, but qualify under <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 7 for inclusion in a <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e under this Law.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e need not include anything that <a href="user.htm">user</a>s can regenerate automatically from other <a href="part.htm">part</a>s of the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2. Basic Permissions.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; All rights granted under this Law are granted for the inclusive terms of <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, copyright and patent holdings on the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, and are irrevocable provided the <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ed conditions are met.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Law explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect.&nbsp;&nbsp;The output from running it is covered by this Law only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Law ac<a href="know.htm">know</a>ledges your rights of "fair <a href="use.htm">use</a>" or other equivalent, as provided by <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, copyright and patent law.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; This Law permits you to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e and run privately <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified versions of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, or have others <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e and run them on your behalf.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this permission terminates, as to all such versions, if you bring suit against anyone for patent infringement of any of your essential patent claims in any such version, for <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing, using, selling or otherwise conveying an <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect based on the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect in compliance with this Law.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a)</small> You may <a href="use.htm">Use</a> the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect if you meet the following requirements:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="insur.htm">INSUR</a>ANCE: <a href="user.htm">User</a> must hold enough <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance points to cover predicted damages.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SAFETY: Some <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hines are dangerous without required <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>. <a href="skill.htm">Skill</a> may be impaired by: fatigue, drugs, disease, lack-of <small>{education, mental or physical capacity,}</small><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SANITARY: Food preparation, medical assistance, lavatory cleanliness, sewage treatment.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="rent.htm">RENT</a>-CYCLE is the duration of exclusive access.&nbsp;&nbsp;Effected by: Demand, zone, <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent holdings.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="rent.htm">RENT</a>-CYCLE is long enough to "<a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e sense" for that <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect and zone.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="rent.htm">RENT</a>-CYCLE is short enough to hamper hoarding.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="rent.htm">RENT</a>-FLOOR is a minimum <a href="rent.htm">RENT</a>-RATE set by <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s and constraints.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="rent.htm">RENT</a>-<a href="note.htm">NOTE</a> is the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency the <a href="rent.htm">RENT</a> may be paid in: good, service, points, external <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="rent.htm">RENT</a>-RATE is set by bidding, so increases according to demand and perceived value.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="rent.htm">RENT</a>-RATE is weighted by past performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;A <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>er's performance is set to neutral, which is hopefully just slightly 'worse' than his actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;A careful <a href="user.htm">user</a> will soon reach 0 and gain according to <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance held.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="rent.htm">RENT</a>-RATE is progressively weighted against <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent holdings - so poor <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> instead of being exploited by those who would hoard.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing Consumer/Inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s are the initial <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership rolls over to those that continue to cover re<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ing <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of those <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es which keeps voting local and <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>s against unneeded division.&nbsp;&nbsp;A consumer's weight should be directly related to his personl desire for the output of that <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e and is measured by his investment in it.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b)</small> You may <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>ify the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect if you <a href="own.htm">own</a> it fully, and receive permission from other <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers in all other cases.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c)</small> Copying covered <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects other than conveying is permitted without limitation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Subleasing is not allowed; <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 10 <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es it unnecessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharing is permitted under the conditions <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ed below.<br/>

&nbsp; Regardless of any other provision of this Law, no permission is given for <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>es of conveying that deny <a href="user.htm">user</a>s that run covered <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects the full exercise of the legal rights granted by this Law.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; No covered <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect constitutes <a href="part.htm">part</a> of an effective <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty "<a href="protect.htm">Protect</a>ion" measure under <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 1201 of <a href="title.htm">Title</a> 17 of the United <a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>es Code or under any other similar creation of any law in any <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the universe.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you convey a covered <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of "<a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ion" measures that include <a href="use.htm">use</a> of the covered <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ification of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect as a means of enforcing the legal rights of third <a href="part.htm">part</a>ies against the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect's <a href="user.htm">user</a>s.<br/>

<br/>
&nbsp;You may copy and convey verbatim copies of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect or of its Design Documents as you receive it, through any medium, provided that you conspicuously and ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riately affix to each copy ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riate <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, copyright and patent notices; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients, along with the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, a copy of this Law and the central list <small>(if any)</small> required by <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;The recipients of these copies will possess all the rights granted by this Law <small>(with any added terms under <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 7)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; You may charge any <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e or no <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e for each copy of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect or of it Design Documents that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ion for a fee.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every <a href="user.htm">user</a> that receives a copy of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect must be given the option of buying controlling shares of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion for this kind of <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect.<br/>

<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a)</small> The <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect and its Design Documents must carry prominent notices <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ing the changes to the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, the date of any change, and the expected implications of those changes.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b)</small> You must <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> or sell the entire <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, as a whole, under this Law to anyone who bids to access it.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Law must apply, unmodified except as permitted by <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 7 below, to the whole of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, and all its <a href="part.htm">part</a>s, regardless of how they are <a href="pack.htm">pack</a>aged.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Law gives no permission to <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> or sell the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c)</small> If the <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect has interactive <a href="user.htm">user</a> interfaces, each must include a convenient feature that displays an ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riate <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, copyright and patent notice, and tells the <a href="user.htm">user</a> that there is no warranty for the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect <small>(or that you provide a warranty)</small>, that <a href="user.htm">user</a>s may convey the <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect under this Law, and how to view a copy of this Law together with the central list <small>(if any)</small> of other terms in accord with <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, if the interface presents a list of <a href="user.htm">user</a> commands or options, such as a <a href="menu.htm">menu</a>, a command to display this information must be prominent in the list; otherwise, the <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect must display this information at <a href="start.htm">start</a>up.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect has interactive interfaces that do not comply with this sub<a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion, your <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect need not <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e them comply.<br/>

To the extent that <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>ntifiable <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ions of the <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, added by you, are not derived from the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects in themselves, then this Law, and its terms, do not apply to those <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ions when you convey them as separate <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects, not specifically for <a href="use.htm">use</a> in combination with the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; A compilation of a covered <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect with other separate and independent <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, in a <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age area or distributed with them, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, copyright or patents are not <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's <a href="user.htm">user</a>s beyond what the individual <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects permit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Inclusion of a covered <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect in an aggregate does not cause this Law to apply to the other <a href="part.htm">part</a>s of the aggregate.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
6.<small>[3]</small> Sharing Non-<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e Forms.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may copy and convey a covered <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect under the terms of <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ions 4 and 5, provided that you also offer shares of controlling <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership under the terms of this Law, in one of these ways:<br/>

The offer of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e in accord with this <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion must be in a format that is publicly documented, such as a deed or <a href="title.htm">title</a> - with an implementation available to the public in <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e code form, and must require no special <a href="pass.htm">pass</a>word or <a href="key.htm">key</a> for un<a href="pack.htm">pack</a>ing, reading or copying.<br/>

7. Additional Terms.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; You may have received the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, or <a href="part.htm">part</a>s of it, under terms that supplement the terms of this Law.&nbsp;&nbsp;These additional terms may include additional permissions, as provided in sub<a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 7a, and additional requirements, as provided in sub<a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 7b.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you convey copies of a covered <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, unless the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect also permits <a href="use.htm">use</a> under a previous version of this Law, it must list, in one central place in the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect's documentation, the complete set of additional terms governing all or <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; a. Additional Permissions.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Additional permissions <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e exceptions from one or more of the requirements of this Law.&nbsp;&nbsp;An <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment containing a clause that permits releasing or conveying under this Law shall be treated as a list of additional permissions, provided that the <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es clear that no requirement in it survives such releasing or conveying.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Any additional permissions that are applicable to the entire <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect are treated as though they were included in this Law, as exceptions to its conditions, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.&nbsp;&nbsp;If additional permissions apply only to <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, that <a href="part.htm">part</a> may be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d separately under those permissions, but the entire <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect remains governed by this Law without regard to the additional terms.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; b. Additional Requirements.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Additional requirements are terms that further constrain Using, <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>ifying, Copying and Sharing of covered <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Law affects only the procedure for enforcing additional requirements, and does not assert that they can be successfully enforced by the copyright holder. Only these kinds of additional requirements are allowed by this Law:<br/>
<br/>
TODO:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-1)</small> terms that require sanitation or security<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0)</small> terms that require preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or <a href="own.htm">own</a>er attributions; or<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1)</small> terms that require that the origin of the material they cover not be misrepresented, or that <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified versions of that material be marked in specific reasonable ways as <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> from the original version; or<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2)</small> warranty or liability disclaimers that <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>er from the disclaimers in this Law; or<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3)</small> terms that prohibit or limit the <a href="use.htm">use</a> for publicity purposes of specified names of <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ers or <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, or that require that certain specified <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e names, <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>emarks, or service marks not be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d for publicity purposes without express permission, other than in ways that are fair <a href="use.htm">use</a> under applicable <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>emark law; or<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4)</small> terms that require, if a <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified version of the material they cover is an <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect intended to interact with <a href="user.htm">user</a>s <a href="remot.htm">remot</a>ely, that those <a href="user.htm">user</a>s be able to obtain copies of the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect through the same <a href="remot.htm">remot</a>e session; or<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5)</small> terms that wholly or <a href="part.htm">part</a>ially terminate, or allow termination of, permission for <a href="use.htm">use</a> of the material they cover, for a <a href="user.htm">user</a> who <a href="file.htm">file</a>s a patent lawsuit <small>(that is, a lawsuit alleging that some <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect infringes a patent)</small> not <a href="file.htm">file</a>d in retaliation or defense against the earlier filing of another patent lawsuit, or in which the allegedly infringing <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect includes some of the covered material, possibly in combination with another <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect; or<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6)</small> terms that are precisely equivalent in type and extent to a requirement expressly <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ed in this Law, or that deny permission for activities that are clearly not permitted, expressly or otherwise, by this Law.<br/>
<br/>
All other additional requirements, including attorney's fees provisions, choice of law, forum, and venue clauses, arbitration clauses, mandatory contractual acceptance clauses, requirements regarding changes to the name of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, and terms that require that conveyed copies be governed by a law other than this Law, are prohibited.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; c. Terms Added or Removed by You.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; When you convey a copy of a covered <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any <a href="part.htm">part</a> of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some additional permissions require their <a href="own.htm">own</a> removal in certain cases when you <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Additional requirements are allowed only as <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ed in sub<a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 7b.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect as you received it purports to impose any other additional requirement, you may remove that requirement.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; You may place additional permissions, or additional requirements as allowed by sub<a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 7b, on material, added by you to a covered <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, for which you have or can give ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riate permission.&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding requirements not allowed by sub<a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 7b is a violation of this Law that may lead to termination of your rights under <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 8.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; If you add terms to a covered <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect in accordance with this <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion, you must place, in the relevant documentation of that <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, a <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ement of the additional terms that apply to those <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
8.<small>[4]</small> Termination.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; You may not <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agate or <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect except as expressly provided under this Law.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any attempt otherwise to <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agate or <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect is void.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you violate this Law, any copyright holder may put you on notice by notifying you of the violation, by any reasonable means, provided 60 days have not elapsed since the last violation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having put you on notice, the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er may then terminate your lease at any time.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, <a href="part.htm">part</a>ies who have received copies, or rights, from you under this Law will not have their leases terminated so long as they remain in full compliance.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
9.<small>[5]</small> Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; You are not required to accept this Law in order to receive or run a copy of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ancillary <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agation of a covered <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect oc<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ing solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, nothing else grants you permission to <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agate or <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect or any covered <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects.&nbsp;&nbsp;These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this Law.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, by <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ifying or <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agating the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect <small>(or any covered <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect)</small>, you indicate your acceptance of this Law to do so, and all its terms and conditions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
10.<small>[6]</small> Automatic Leasing of Downstream <a href="user.htm">User</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Each time you convey a covered <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, the recipient automatically receives a <a href="title.htm">title</a> from the original <a href="own.htm">own</a>er, to <a href="use.htm">use</a>, <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify, copy and share that <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, subject to this Law, including any additional terms introduced through <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights thus granted or affirmed, except in the limited ways permitted by <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 7. Therefore, you may not impose a lease fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this Law.&nbsp;&nbsp;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third <a href="part.htm">part</a>ies to this Law.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; If <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agation results from a transaction transferring control of an organization, each <a href="part.htm">part</a>y to that transaction who receives a copy of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect also receives a <a href="title.htm">title</a> of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership and a right to possession of the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect from the <a href="part.htm">part</a>y's predecessor in interest.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
11. Patents, Treaties and <a href="agree.htm">Agree</a>ments<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; You receive the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect with a covenant from each <a href="own.htm">own</a>er and conveyor of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, and of any material, conveyed under this Law, on which the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect is based, that the covenanting <a href="part.htm">part</a>y will not assert <small>(or cause others to assert)</small> any of the <a href="part.htm">part</a>y's essential Patent, Treaty or <a href="agree.htm">Agree</a>ment claims in the material that the <a href="part.htm">part</a>y conveyed, against you, arising from your exercise of rights under this Law. If you convey a covered <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, you similarly covenant to all recipients, including recipients of <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects based on the covered <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, not to assert any of your essential Patent, Treaty or <a href="agree.htm">Agree</a>ment claims in the covered <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; If you convey a covered <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, <a href="know.htm">know</a>ingly relying on a Patent, Treaty or <a href="agree.htm">Agree</a>ment that is not generally available to all, you must either <small>(1)</small> act to shield downstream <a href="user.htm">user</a>s against the possible infringement claims from which your lease <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>s you, or <small>(2)</small> ensure that anyone can copy the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e of the covered <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, <a href="free.htm">free</a> of charge and under the terms of this Law, through a publicly available business or other readily accessible means.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Nothing in this Law shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied lease or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable Patent, Treaty or <a href="agree.htm">Agree</a>ment laws.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
12.<small>[7]</small> No Surrender of Others' <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; If conditions are imposed on you <small>(whether by court order, <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment or otherwise)</small> that con<a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ict the conditions of this Law, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this Law.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you cannot convey the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, or other covered <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this Law and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if you accept a patent lease that prohibits royalty-<a href="free.htm">free</a> conveying by those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this Law would be to refrain entirely from conveying the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<small>[13.<small>[8]</small> Geographical Limitations.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; If the conveying and/or <a href="use.htm">use</a> of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect under this Law may add an explicit geographical limitation on conveying, excluding those countries, so that conveying is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.&nbsp;&nbsp;In such case, this Law incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this Law.]</small><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
14.<small>[9]</small> Revised Versions of this Law.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The Personal Sovereignty Foundation may publish revised and/or <a href="new.htm">new</a> versions of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public law.htm">General Public Law</a> from time to time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such <a href="new.htm">new</a> versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>er in detail to address <a href="new.htm">new</a> problems or concerns.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect specifies that a certain numbered version of this Law "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Personal Sovereignty Foundation.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect does not specify a version number of this Law, you may choose any version ever published by the Personal Sovereignty Foundation.<br/>

<small>[15.<small>[10]</small> Requesting Exceptions.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; If you wish to incorporate <a href="part.htm">part</a>s of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect into other <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects under other conditions, write to the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er to ask for permission.&nbsp;&nbsp;For <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by the Personal Sovereignty Foundation, write to the Personal Sovereignty Foundation; we sometimes <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e exceptions for this.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our decision will be <a href="gui.htm">gui</a>ded by the two goals of preserving the <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>us of all derivatives of our <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects and of promoting the sharing and reuse of <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects generally.]</small><br/>
