<hr/><span class="date">Nov-21-2012:</span> Crowd Control<br/>
<br/>
In the future, crowds will <a href="fund.htm">fund</a> the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of their <a href="own.htm">own</a> basic needs.<br/>
They will cross-commit <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="land.htm">land</a> and tools<br/>
They will cross-commit <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>es of future labor<br/>
They will share <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es to allocate the finished goods to thos<br/>
Each will become the <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>er in the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of that for which they need the outputs.<br/>
They will buy and <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> the <a href="land.htm">land</a>, water-rights, flora/fauna/fungi, tools, energy required to create all of their <a href="own.htm">own</a> food, housing, transport, health-care, transportation, etc. they <a href="know.htm">know</a> they will need.<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers, when acting as consumers, <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion when they buy finished goods and services.<br/>
So they might as well invest and become <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers with <a href="real.htm">real</a> control of those results.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers, acting as consumers, will buy the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of the goods and services they need by <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>ing to <a href="work.htm">work</a> in the future for others who are committing <a href="work.htm">work</a> of another ind or are committing <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y or <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder why we are so scared and feeble that we will not accept the risks of <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership even though we <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for all those risks in the end anyway, and we <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all other <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s *and* we <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> because we refuse to organize for our <a href="own.htm">own</a> mutual benefit.<br/>
<br/>
We cannot do this alone in gardens. Most people do not have those <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s, and this pretends we do not need specialization to compete against the many-headed beast of corporatism.<br/>
<br/>
Monsanto is just doing what every other <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>-seeking entity must do: destroy all alternatives so wealth is concentrated into the hands of the shareholders.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, and also understanding that a "<a href="promis.htm">promis</a>e to <a href="work.htm">work</a>"<br/>

Yes!&nbsp;&nbsp;This is so important!&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of what <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y is<br/>
about has to do with "time delay" in <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
As you say, <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ing <a href="work.htm">work</a> early eliminates the<br/>
usual need to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> wages.<br/>
<br/>
While sharing <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es* early eliminates the need to<br/>
buy those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts because they are "pre-allocated"<br/>
to each consumer already - in the same % as their<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts.<br/>
<br/>
<small>(*)</small> I sometimes <a href="use.htm">use</a> the word <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es as another<br/>
phrase for "Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion", mostly because<br/>

This is supposedly solved by the Terms of Operation<br/>

<br/>
The target is set by developers<br/>

The potential for exploitation<br/>

Henry George says tax <small>(<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>)</small> must weigh against speculation, not <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
For example, who should should we tax more in this scenario?:<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> A <a href="real.htm">real</a>-e<a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e group holding 1 acre of idle <a href="land.htm">land</a> very near the city.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> A permaculture group <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing 1 acres of <a href="land.htm">land</a> very near the city.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="curr.htm">Curr</a>ent taxation would give #1 a nearly <a href="free.htm">free</a>-ride for squandering <a href="land.htm">land</a>,<br/>
while #2 is punished severely for growing food and accomplishing goals.<br/>
<br/>
How do we become so confused that we want to punish abundance?<br/>
It is only because we refuse to r<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>sider the purpose of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
We do not see how <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t can be a Direct Return on Investment <small>(DROI)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
We do not see that Consumers can be the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers, and so do not see that<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t can be pre-allocated to those who need it and in this way<br/>
<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e == <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> and <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is safely eliminated.<br/>
<br/>
We ignorantly strive to keep <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>, and so we strive for<br/>
scarcity and worry about others 'dumping' goods at a low <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e.<br/>
Abundance is seen as dangerous because the goals of our inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s<br/>
conflicts with the goals of the consumers.<br/>
<br/>
This conflict will be resolved when we finally see that consumers can<br/>
be the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s <small>(they already <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s anyway)</small>, and the<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t will be the natural ROI for those stakeholders without the<br/>
need to ever sell the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t at all <small>(except surplus)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Under these conditions, government and business can safely merge, and<br/>
so tax will be collected by each group in the form of 'dues' to cover<br/>
<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s, and in the form of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> when charging non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers who buy<br/>
surplus <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t.<br/>
