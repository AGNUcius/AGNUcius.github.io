<br/>
There is a <a href="part.htm">part</a>ial similarity between <a href="free.htm">free</a> software and globalization, but also a major <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence.<br/>
<br/>
The advocates of "<a href="free.htm">free</a>" <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e, and neoliberalism in general, argue that it creates wealth. That is true--but it also concentrates wealth. The result is that only the rich benefit. The poor gain little; they may even they lose, as has happened in the US.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="free.htm">Free</a> software is <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>, because it <a href="work.htm">work</a>s against the concentration of wealth. <small>(Copyright is a major factor for concentration.)</small> So when <a href="free.htm">free</a> software creates more wealth, the benefits are general.<br/>
<br/>
This is how <a href="free.htm">free</a> software can be beneficial, while global "<a href="free.htm">free</a>" <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e is harmful.<br/>
<br/>
I put the "<a href="free.htm">free</a>" in "<a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e" in scare quotes because it is a misnomer. <a href="trad.htm">Trad</a>e is still restricted, but now it is restricted by copyrights and patents rather than specific laws. These treaties do not eliminate control over <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e; rather, they transfer it from governments, which sometimes respond to the well-being of their citizens, to corporations <small>(usually foreign)</small>, which don't recognize a concern for the public.]</small><br/>
<br/>
I want to respond directly to <a href="rms.htm">RMS</a> in an e<a href="mail.htm">mail</a> that will try to communicate how <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional collective holdings using either private <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty law or representative government do not allocate physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es in any manner whatsoever, so concentration cannot be avoided without an extra 'constraint' similar to the copy<a href="left.htm">left</a> requirements of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>.<br/>

<hr/><span class="date">Sep-28-2007:</span> Posted to <a class="ext" href="http://AGNUcius.GooglePages.com">AGNUcius.GooglePages.com</a>:<br/>
Hello there.&nbsp;&nbsp;My <a href="new.htm">new</a> name is Lord <a href="agnu.htm">AGNU</a>cius.<br/>
<br/>
I am on a quest to reveal what I have uncovered about the troubles we see in our social <a href="operating system.htm">operating system</a> as indicated by our dangerous addiction to scarcity for the purpose of <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ing <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es from reaching <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>, and the insane notion that <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ment is a need in itself instead of a burden we would want to minimize.<br/>
<br/>
There is a flaw in the allocation routines of our OS that inefficiently centralize control of collective holdings instead of causing that control to be distributed according to the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> each <a href="user.htm">user</a> invests as measured by what is usually called <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>. <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is <a href="calc.htm">calc</a>ulated as the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e and <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>, and should be interpreted as an investment by the <a href="user.htm">user</a> that just paid it. This maximizes competition and drives <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e toward <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s and therefore <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> <small>(consumer investment)</small> toward zero while continuously distributing control as <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
Whether the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es <small>(means of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion)</small> are being managed as a public utility under a representative government or as private <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty in a corporate setting, the consumers of the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects <small>(<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts)</small> of those <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es do not <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently gain or lose control in the dynamic manner needed to <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e control flows according to the will to invest as measured by the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment of <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Because of this, initial inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s and organizers of governments and corporations <small>(even when non-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> retain too much vote weight which becomes a sort of power over <a href="new.htm">new</a>comers and generally over those that do not otherwise organize for themselves. Another effect is excessively coarse granularity in decision <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing and general loss of <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom that stymies <a href="real.htm">real</a>istic divisibility and direct democracy.<br/>
<br/>
This truth could not have been invented by me or by anyone else, it is only so. While the core <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>as are sublimely simple, there are many fine points in need of examination to determine how they should most efficiently play out. It will probably require a <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>amental change in your world view to understand and accept, so might be revealed as a flash of insight <small>(as it was with me)</small> instead of as a slow, determined construction of facts.<br/>

Hello Christian,<br/>
<br/>
I was very excited to read your paper, as I have been <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing on the same or a very similar thing since the late <a href="part.htm">part</a> of 1999.<br/>
<br/>
In it you say <span class="quot">"'A <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>e of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion has emerged in the areas of software and content <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion during the last decades.&nbsp;&nbsp;This <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>e, which is based on sharing and cooperation, has spawned whole mature <a href="operating system.htm">operating system</a>s such as <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a>/Linux ...'"</span><br/>
<br/>
Which seems to imply the importance of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Later you say <span class="quot">"'Peer <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion thus fulfills the old Marxist postulate that "control over the means of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion should be in the hands of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers".'"</span><br/>
<br/>
But the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> is very clear in it's goal to <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e the <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <small>(<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code)</small> should be in the hands of the CONSUMERS.<br/>
<br/>
When <a href="rms.htm">RMS</a> speaks of <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom it is always about the <a href="user.htm">User</a> <small>(consumer)</small>, not developer, author, <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>er, <a href="work.htm">work</a>er or <a href="own.htm">own</a>er.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, <a class="ext" href="http://GNU.org/philosophy/freedom-or-power.html">http://GNU.org/philosophy/freedom-or-power.html</a> says <span class="quot">"'<a href="prop.htm">Prop</a>rietary software is an exercise of power.&nbsp;&nbsp;Copyright law today grants software developers that power, so they and only they choose the rules to impose on everyone else—a relatively few people <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e the basic software decisions for everyone, typically by denying their <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom.&nbsp;&nbsp;When <a href="user.htm">user</a>s lack the <a href="free.htm">free</a>doms that define <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software, they can't tell what the software is doing, can't check for <a href="back.htm">back</a> doors, can't <a href="moni.htm">moni</a>tor possible viruses and worms, can't find out what personal information is being reported <small>(or stop the reports, even if they do find out)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;If it breaks, they can't fix it; they have to wait for the developer to exercise its power to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;If it simply isn't quite what they need, they are stuck with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;They can't help each other improve it.'"</span><br/>
<br/>
And the recent interview "Three Minutes with Ric<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> <a href="stallman.htm">Stallman</a>" at <a class="ext" href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,137098-c,freeware/article.html">http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,137098-c,freeware/article.html</a> says <span class="quot">"'With <a href="free.htm">free</a> software, the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s are in control.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the time, <a href="user.htm">user</a>s want interoperability, and when the software is <a href="free.htm">free</a>, they get what they want.&nbsp;&nbsp;With non-<a href="free.htm">free</a> software, the developer controls the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;The developer permits interoperability when that suits the developer; what the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s want is beside the point.'"</span><br/>
<br/>
If a "<a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>e of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion" is defined by who controls the "Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion", then the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>e of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion is one in which the Consumers and NOT the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ers are at the helm.<br/>
<br/>
What say ye to such a monkey wrench?&nbsp;&nbsp;I am continuing with this interesting read and plan to post more at a later time.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Patrick Anderson<br/>

<hr/><span class="date">Sep-24-2007:</span> Posted to: <a class="ext" href="http://Progress.org/2007/cpower.htm">Progress.org/2007/cpower.htm</a><br/>
Creating corporations that serve the public good will not <a href="work.htm">work</a> if they are <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ees, as they will still be striving to maximize <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> instead of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
It is true that <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers will always require a wage <small>(<a href="calc.htm">calc</a>ulated as a <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>)</small> for <a href="work.htm">work</a> they would otherwise be disinterested in, but the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion must be in the hands of the Consumers if we are ever to have the <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom to do the right thing instead of destroying nature to keep <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
When <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is treated as an investment from the Consumer that just paid it, <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the physical re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es needed for an <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>t for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion will be in the hands of those that can safely maximize abundance and attempt to eliminate <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ment instead of relying upon the dangerous insanity of <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity and the myth of <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ment as a 'need'.<br/>
<br/>
It is Consumption we must guarantee, not the perpetuation of <a href="work.htm">work</a>!<br/>
<br/>
Self governance means each individual controls their <a href="own.htm">own</a> destiny without needing to beg those that invested early or who happen to have those <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s to "do the right thing".&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumers will choose to do the right thing out of self interest when they ARE the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.&nbsp;&nbsp;In that special case <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> doesn't even have meaning except as more investment.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure you will ignore me and will instead continue to beg and wonder why we allow <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> to inverts our goals.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<hr/><span class="date">Sep-23-2007:</span> I was thinking to write "<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the Problem" as a catchphrase, but the more I thought, I <a href="real.htm">real</a>ized <small>(or maybe remembered)</small> that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly just an *indication* of the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is closer to being a lack of competition caused by our failure to have a system of dynamic <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty allocation that would cause <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> to approach zero as consumers gained <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership according to the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> they invest as measured by the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> they are willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
It is not immediatly clear that humans would need such a continuous distribution of physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar to how the purposes and effects of <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a> are so <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult to explain, I am more and more convinced that communicating this message will only come through implementation, as I can't seem to get the words stacked in a digestible order.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public law.htm">General Public Law</a> must most closely approach that goal of definition, so I will try to focus on that over the next while.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, but perfect competition would require the consumers <small>(<a href="user.htm">user</a>s)</small> have control, not the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers.&nbsp;&nbsp;That control can be delivered as <a href="real.htm">real</a> controlling shares of collective private <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es <small>(or toward the purchase of similar <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es when there are no shares of the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent factory or farm "up for sale")</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot2">>> I think that a big problem with the <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy in general is that consumers have no control on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Multinational companies rule the roost and reign over customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, <a href="stallman.htm">Stallman</a> was motivated to create the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> project because a printer manufacturer refused to give the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code of a driver.&nbsp;&nbsp;25 years later, <a href="free.htm">free</a> drivers may exist for some printers, but the situation has not <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly improved, <a href="free.htm">free</a> software developers are often obliged to reverse-engineer printer protocols, and customers are forced to buy printers that break down just after the guarantee and can't be repaired, ink cartridges more expensive than the printer, etc.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> As I said, consumers and <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers are not two separate classes, <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers are <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers are.</span><br/>

<br/>
What is <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency, and does personal issuance have any validity?&nbsp;&nbsp;My guess is that <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y serves 2 purposes:<br/>
<br/>
1. Represent value <small>(as a <a href="title.htm">title</a> of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership)</small> for physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.<br/>

Thanks for the feed<a href="back.htm">back</a> Simon.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been trying to simplify, but am always lured into trying to <a href="paint.htm">paint</a> too much of the <a href="pic.htm">pic</a>ture.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, to reorient ourselves I will respond to a quote from the original <a href="art.htm">art</a>icle:<br/>
<span class="quot">"'firms face an inhe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> conflict between value creation and value capture.'"</span><br/>
<br/>
My central concern is that we have accepted this conflict as a tautology of human interaction with no alternative.<br/>
<br/>
But there is a special case in social systems that occurs when the Consumers of a good or service are the very <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers of the capital necessary for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
That case, which is <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itionally called a <a class="ext" href="http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumers%27_cooperative">Wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumers%27_cooperative</a> removes that conflict to leave the <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipants to resolve other issues.<br/>
<br/>
My vision of this is not "one member/one vote" as described on the Wikipedia page, but is instead to have votes weighted by <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership percentages.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is safe because of the way that <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership would be dynamically <a href="real.htm">real</a>located across time to remain in the hands of those using those goods or services, which is why I talk about "<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as <a href="user.htm">user</a> investment".<br/>

This appears to me to be the same pattern described by the Nash Equilibrium or the Prisoner’s Dilemma - where an individual may choose a <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>off that is not the best for the group, but is better than the worst for himself; maybe out of fear or because there wasn’t a prior arrangement that could have ensured the other <a href="part.htm">part</a>y would also be bound to choose the best alternative.<br/>

<span class="quot">> It sounds as if you are saying that the capital re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e earned by industry should be distributed among those that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e the goods, and not accrued by those that initiate and develop the industry.</span><br/>
<br/>
No, sorry, that is not what I am saying. It is not those that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e that must become the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, it is the those that consume that must become the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
When <a href="user.htm">user</a>s <small>(consumers)</small> <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> a <a href="pric.htm">PRIC</a>E for some good or service, they are <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing for the <a href="cost.htm">COST</a>S of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion that the capital <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers in<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ed for that round of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, and those <a href="user.htm">user</a>s usually also <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> an a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> above <a href="cost.htm">COST</a>S which is <small>(in a simplified manner)</small> generally <a href="calc.htm">calc</a>ulated as <a href="profit.htm">PROFIT</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">PROFIT</a> is therefore the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between Consumer_<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e and <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s, and is a rough measure of incomplete monopoly. In other words, <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is an inverse measure of competition, and is ‘balanced’ or even eliminated when it becomes an investment for the <a href="user.htm">User</a> that just paid it.<br/>
<br/>
I will quote myself to fix a typo and to begin an example as Michel suggested to try to prove that it is the Consumers and NOT the <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers that must be the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers of physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es for us to approach a perfected <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy:<br/>
<br/>
"<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ing expensive capital with a group of other <a href="user.htm">user</a>s is valuable even when none of you can operate it because you can always hire that <a href="work.htm">work</a> done - and would treat those wages as a <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of operation, but could never <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> unless you were to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> it to yourselves."<br/>
<br/>
Let’s say a <a href="work.htm">work</a>er comes to your door asking to aerate your lawn. Aerators are generally too expensive to <a href="own.htm">own</a> for just one lawn, but you need the <a href="job.htm">job</a> done, so you <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the <a href="pric.htm">PRIC</a>E of $30.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="pric.htm">PRIC</a>E includes the <a href="cost.htm">COST</a>S of:<br/>
&nbsp; Investment: If the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er has not yet <a href="recover.htm">recover</a>ed the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e he paid for the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine.<br/>
&nbsp; Maintenance: Wear, Oil, Fuel<br/>
&nbsp; Wages: Whatever the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er and <a href="own.htm">own</a>er negotiate.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="pric.htm">PRIC</a>E also includes <a href="profit.htm">PROFIT</a> for the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er that instantly increases the moment the capital has been “paid off”.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if you and a bunch of your neighbors got together to buy your <a href="own.htm">OWN</a> aerator, you would still have all the same <a href="cost.htm">COST</a>S as mentioned above which could be covered by each of you <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ing the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine from the collective others, but <a href="profit.htm">PROFIT</a> would have no meaning, as <a href="pric.htm">PRIC</a>E and <a href="cost.htm">COST</a>S would be <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>ntical. Furthermore, when the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine was finally “paid off”, the <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>al <a href="pric.htm">PRIC</a>E would fall even further, as that <a href="cost.htm">COST</a> would be eliminated.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> Tell me, does Open-<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e eliminate the kinds of income based on ‘<a href="real.htm">real</a>’ scarcity? <small>(as opposed to the <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity you mentioned above?)</small></span><br/>
<br/>
The ‘<a href="real.htm">real</a>’ scarcity that will probably never be fully eliminated, even when all <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es are finally <a href="free.htm">Free</a>, is the FUTURE <a href="work.htm">work</a> that continues to be needed.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, <a href="user.htm">user</a>s of <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software would <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers to fix bugs or add features if we could only get them connected in such a manner - a sort of “<a href="promis.htm">promis</a>e to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>” pot that other <a href="user.htm">user</a>s wanting the same changes could add to so developer would have incentive to <a href="work.htm">work</a> on stuff they may otherwise have no interest in.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, the group <a href="user.htm">user</a>/<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of the aerator would also need someone to operate and repair the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine if they couldn’t or didn’t want to do those <a href="job.htm">job</a>s themselves.<br/>

Simon, while it may seem unimportant to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion available to <a href="user.htm">user</a>s that have no <a href="skill.htm">skill</a> in that field, the reason it is important is that it eliminates the kinds of income based on <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity.<br/>
<br/>
The un<a href="skill.htm">skill</a>ed <a href="user.htm">user</a> may always hire a <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>ed <a href="work.htm">work</a>er and <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> those wages as a <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>, but the <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional concept of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> through unnecessary restriction no longer applies.<br/>
<br/>
The same is true for the physical world.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ing expensive capital with a group of other <a href="user.htm">user</a>s is valuable even when none of you can operate it because you can always hire that <a href="work.htm">work</a> done - and would treat those wages as a <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of operation, but could never <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> unless you were to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> it yourselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;This causes <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e to approach <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s which is far less than the expense we <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <small>(especially when we consider the lack of <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom those corporations impose upon us as an unneeded expense)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
This applies to any industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;How much does it <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly <a href="cost.htm">COST</a> <small>(not the <a href="pric.htm">PRIC</a>E charged)</small> to add another customer to a cell-phone <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>?&nbsp;&nbsp;What would be the result if the <a href="user.htm">User</a>s <small>(consumers)</small> of that <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> were the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers of those physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es in direct <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ortion to the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> they are willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s?<br/>
<br/>
But, since groups are not <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ic, this 'requirement' would also need to be applied to every <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="user.htm">user</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers could choose to syndicate such an arrangement through a legally binding contract that they would impose upon themselves and upon all <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="user.htm">user</a>s.<br/>

<hr/><span class="date">Sep-07-2007:</span> Posted to <a class="ext" href="http://Blog.P2PFoundation.net/we-need-a-revolution-that-does-not-demand-we-need-a-revolution-that-creates/2007/07/23">Blog.P2PFoundation.net/we-need-a-revolution-that-does-not-demand-we-need-a-revolution-that-creates/2007/07/23</a><br/>
Your term "Continuous Revolution" combined with "Complete Distribution" gives us "Continuous Distribution" which I think captures the <a href="real.htm">real</a> viral quality of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Continuous Distribution is something a community needs if it is to "<a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d upon the sand" because groups are dynamic in at least two ways: <a href="user.htm">User</a>s <small>(consumers)</small> come and go <small>(even if just through birth and death)</small>, and each <a href="user.htm">user</a>'s choices also changes over time.<br/>
<br/>
This is in alignment with what I've been trying to formulate as "Perfected <small>(not perfect)</small> Competition" that occurs when the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <small>(whether <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual or material)</small> are somehow made available to the <a href="user.htm">user</a> that just bought or received the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects <small>(whether <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual or material)</small> of those <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
Perfected Competition through Continuous Distribution is now mostly 'solved' for the <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual <a href="real.htm">real</a>m by <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers who apply the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> to the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects they invested in <small>(that investment being mostly labor - when they develop software for instance)</small>, but now we need an analogous solution for the material world.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> is a <a href="free.htm">Free</a> <small>(as in <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom)</small> <a href="trad.htm">Trad</a>e <a href="agree.htm">Agree</a>ment.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not an End <a href="user.htm">User</a> License <a href="agree.htm">Agree</a>ment <small>(EULA)</small>, because it has no restrictions on "<a href="use.htm">Use</a>"; it only comes into effect when the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect <small>(say a software executable)</small> is <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ed <small>(or shared/conveyed/<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agated)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent instance <a href="own.htm">own</a>er is required to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e the <a href="virt.htm">Virt</a>ual <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of that <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect available to that <a href="user.htm">user</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s in some material Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <small>(what I call Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es)</small> could choose to apply a contract to those things <small>(such as <a href="land.htm">land</a>, water, tools, plants, animals, etc.)</small> so that whenever the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts <small>(<a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects)</small> of those things are <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ed <small>(most likely sold)</small>, that the <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="user.htm">user</a> would somehow gain access to the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es needed for more of that kind of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
It is clear that Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es cannot be just handed over in the same way that <a href="virt.htm">Virt</a>ual <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <small>(such as <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code)</small> are because they are rivalrous.&nbsp;&nbsp;So the contract mentioned above must do something that somehow increases <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty holdings for the <a href="user.htm">user</a> that just bought that <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect.<br/>
<br/>
After much study, it appears to me that '<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>' <small>(the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between consumer <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e and <a href="own.htm">own</a>er <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s)</small> could be treated as an investment for that same <a href="user.htm">user</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, as bread is purchased, the plea for growth <small>(which is one thing <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> measures)</small> would be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d by those <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers to buy more Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <small>(<a href="land.htm">land</a>, seed, tools, etc.)</small> needed to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e more bread, and that those investments would become the <a href="real.htm">REAL</a> <a href="proper.htm">PROPER</a>TY of that very same <a href="user.htm">user</a> <small>(though I don't think it should be instantaneous, and don't <a href="know.htm">know</a> when the handoff should occur)</small> so that Competition is Perfected as Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es are Continuously Distributed.<br/>
<br/>
This plan hinges on some initial inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s willing to forgo <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>, but those investments can be smaller if the number of inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s is higher.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="user.htm">User</a>s are already willing to invest <small>(that is what <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> should always be understood to be)</small> while expecting only <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, so we <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly only need get this '<a href="boot.htm">boot</a>ed' for it to grow exponentially.<br/>
<br/>
Please let me <a href="know.htm">know</a> what you see as sticking points, or how it seems implausible.<br/>
<br/>
Let's perpetuate <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom by <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ing <a href="user own.htm">user own</a>ership.<br/>
