The Birth of <a href="insur.htm">Insur</a>ance<br/>
Copyright <small>(c)</small> 2005 by Nick Szabo<br/>
<small>(Here's an excerpt from a hi<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>y of commercial institutions that I am writing.)</small><br/>
<br/>
Northern Italy responded to the crises of the 14th century in a remarkable way -- with further innovation. In short succession Genoa developed <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance, <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance pools secured by <a href="land.htm">land</a>ed e<a href="stat.htm">stat</a>es, and re<a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance. Exchanges sprang up for <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ing public debt, commodity futures, and other commercial paper. <a href="bank.htm">Bank</a>ruptcy law and the settlement of international <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e disputes reached new levels of sophistication. Accounting became widespread and double-entry bookkeeping was born. As a result of their cumulative breakthroughs in institutions and technology, Europeans became the first merchants to travel and <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e around the entire globe.<br/>
<br/>
The earliest risk-pooling <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance contracts were structured similarly to, and enforced under the same legal principals as, loans. Indeed they bundled a loan from the combined inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>/<a href="insur.htm">insur</a>er with an <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance clause -- in the event that the ship was wrecked, the loan need not be paid <a href="back.htm">back</a>. In 14th century Genoa, we see the separation of the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a> from the <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>er, via a contract with its conditional clause but requiring no initial loan. Investment contracts became separate entities and could be contracted with <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> <a href="part.htm">part</a>ies, greatly improving the spreading of risk for these ventures. Such improved risk management was crucial for the explosion of overseas <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e that Europe initiated over the succeeding centuries.<br/>
<br/>
The following contract illustrates a <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance pool -- one of the earliest <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance pools. The pool consists of many counter<a href="part.htm">part</a>ies, each pledging his entire <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty as security. Often these were feudal lords with large <a href="land.htm">land</a>holdings, so the value that could be brought to bear to <a href="back.htm">back</a> these <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance contracts was vast. This is how Lloyds Names still <a href="work.htm">work</a> today. Since several Names <a href="back.htm">back</a> a single contract <small>(e.g. covering a single shipment of goods, as here)</small>, each Name puts only a tiny <a href="fract.htm">fract</a>ion of their e<a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e at risk in that voyage. An <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance exchange like Lloyds allows the agents of goods <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, shippers, and Names to meet and mass-<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e these kinds of contracts. Such oc<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ed, albeit in a more sporadic and awkward way, in 15th century Genoa. Here we see an early contract that is still structured legally as a loan, by the neat trick of simply <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing the initial loan a fictional <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Geri, <small>[son]</small> of the late Ser Lapo of Florence, Si<a href="mone.htm">mone</a> Guascone, <small>[9 more Names listed]</small>, each of them <small>[liable]</small> for the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> written below, have ac<a href="know.htm">know</a>ledged and in truth have declared to me, notary undersigned, as a public official <small>[holding]</small> a public office, <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing the stipulation and receiving in the name and stead of Federico Vivaldi, citizen of Genoa, that they have bought, have had, and have received from him a certain a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of goods of the said Frederico...And for these goods and in consideration of their <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e each of them has <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>ed to give and to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> to said Frederico or to his accr<a href="edit.htm">edit</a>ed messenger: <small>[from]</small> the said Geri,150 <a href="gold.htm">gold</a> florins, the said Si<a href="mone.htm">mone</a>, 50 florins, <small>[100 florins each from the other Names]</small> within the next five months from now. Otherwise they have <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>ed to give and to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> to the said Frederico the penalty of the double of it and of the entire a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> to which and to the extent of which <small>[this <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment]</small> is violated or is not observed as above, together with restitution of all losses, un<a href="real.htm">real</a>ized <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s, and expenses which might be in<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ed because of it in court or outside -- the aforesaid remaining as settled, and under hypothecation and pledge of their goods and <small>[the goods]</small> of any one of them, existing and future.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <small>[The above is binding]</small> with the exception and special reservation that if the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of goods, <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, and merchandise which was loaded or is to be loaded by Frederico Imperiale or by another in his behalf for the account of the said Frederico Vivaldi in Aigues-Mortes -- to be transported to Ayassoluk and Rhodes or to either of these two localities in a certain ship...and which de<a href="part.htm">part</a>ed from Aigues-Mortes or is about to de<a href="part.htm">part</a> in order to sail to aforesaid regions -- is brought and unloaded in the said location of Ayasoluk and Rhodes or in either of them, in safety, then and in such a case the present instrument is canceled, void, and of no value and pro rata. And be it understood that such a risk begins when the said ship de<a href="part.htm">part</a>s and sets sail from Aigues-Mortes, and it remains and lasts, while the captain goes, stays <small>[in port]</small>, sails, loads and unloads, from the said locality of Aigues-Mortres up to the said localities of Ayassoluk and Rhodes, in whatever manner and way he wishes, until said a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of goods, <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty,and merchandise has been brought and unloaded in Ayassoluk and Rhodes or in either of these two localities in safety, and pro rata. Let the present instrument also be canceled if the said Frederico refrains from asking <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ments of the aforesaid a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a>s of <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y for the <a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e of one year after the time or the time limit has elapsed for asking or obtaining their <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment....Done as above, September 15th, around nones. <small>[1393 A.D.]</small><br/>
<br/>
Frederico's forebears were pioneers in exploring, and perhaps <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ing with, the west coast of Africa, as far as the southern hemisphere, in the 13th century.<br/>
<br/>
This <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance contract was still, legally speaking, a loan. This had at least two interesting consequences on what we now call the <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance premium. Firstly, the premium was treated as goods purchased by the <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>er on cr<a href="edit.htm">edit</a>. S<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>dly, even at this late date, contracts were coy about the actual value of such goods. Leaving the value of those goods unspecified made usury <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult to prove in this "loan", and as usual the Genoese courts were happy to ignore usury as long as the merchants were being reasonably discrete about it. In the case of <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance, the Church was quick to recognize that what was being paid for here was a <a href="real.htm">real</a> risk, and therefore not usury.<br/>
<br/>
Conceptually, <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance contracts were a big step in the abstraction of risk. Their similarity to gambling would become appa<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>. The first book on <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance, On <a href="insur.htm">Insur</a>ance and Merchant's Bets, <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es the connection. It was written by the Portuguese lawyer Santera, in 1488, at a time when the Portuguese, financed by Genoese inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s, were <a href="start.htm">start</a>ing to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e many dangerous <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ing voyages down the west coast of Africa. Santera summarized the <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance contract as follows -- "I undertake the peril, for your giving me <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y, as is the understanding of Baldus." Santera argues that the good intentions of the contracting <a href="part.htm">part</a>ies must be p<a href="resume.htm">resume</a>d, even though <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance and betting could be a cloak for usury. Since life is full of uncertain events, everybody by necessity <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es bets. A lawyer must for a variety of reasons be able to determine what the just <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e <small>(the <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern "fair value")</small> of an <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance contract is. For example, a lawyer must determine whether there was consideration in the contract <small>(under the most common understanding and stemming from Roman law, consideration had to be at least half the just <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e)</small>. In <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ting damages, the value of the <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance contract is also often relevant. Franklin <small>[ref]</small> gives the following example from Santera -- "If someone charges 16 percent in circumstances for which 8 percent is usual, it may be inferred <small>[as a rebuttable presumption]</small> that the <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance was intended to cover a s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>d voyage. If a ship's master defers sailing until a more dangerous time of year, a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e previously just may become unjust."<br/>
<br/>
By 1488 the Genoese already had a very sophisticated <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance industry, and the Portuguese were <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing <a href="use.htm">use</a> of it on risky <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ing voyages down the west coast of Africa. Genoese inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s and commercial practices played a leading role not only in the African <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e, but in the colonization of the Atlantic Is<a href="land.htm">land</a>s <small>(Azores, Canaries, and Madeiras)</small>. The Genoese and Portuguese established sugar plantations and vineyards on these is<a href="land.htm">land</a>s; by 1465 Madeieras sugar could be bought in London.<br/>
<br/>
In the decade after of Santera penned his book on <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance, the Portuguese and Genoese would be putting European innovations to even more spectacular <a href="use.htm">use</a>. Their ships were financed by sophisticated investment and <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance schemes, brimmed with European cannon <small>(mostly made in Germany, Hungary, and Northern Italy)</small>, <a href="use.htm">use</a>d a com<a href="pass.htm">pass</a> new to Europe, measured velocity for dead reckoning with the help of the sand glass, and measured location with newly printed navigation tables and ephemerides. In 1492 the Genoese navigator Christopher Columbus, seeking Asian spices by a westward route, discovered America. Columbus from early in his career was an agent for Genoese inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s in the Madeira is<a href="land.htm">land</a>s. The Madeiras were an early Atlantic conquest of the Portuguese crown and Genoese inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s. Columbus' voyage to find a westward route to the Indies was <a href="back.htm">back</a>ed by a consortium of Castilian and Genoese inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s. The Genoese also plaid a substantial role in <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing the subsequent Spanish colonization of the Americas by Columbus and his successors.<br/>
<br/>
In 1498 the Portuguese Vasco Da Gama, following up on previous Portuguese exploration and <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ing voyages down the coast of Africa to the southern hemisphere, pioneered the sea route to the Orient from the Atlantic shores of Europe, via the Cape of Good Hope <small>(South Africa)</small>. There followed large numbers of commercial spice fleets, <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ed by Genoese, Venetian, and German merchants among others. The Portuguese royal fleet and privateers, both often financed by loans from these same inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s, conquered or purchased Hormuz, Malacca <small>(near <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern Singapore)</small>, Goa, and <a href="mac.htm">Mac</a>au, gaining control of the vast wealth of the Southeast Asian sea <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e, and <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ing spices and other Oriental wealth to Western Europe for silver, a commodity quite scarce in Southeast Asia but highly <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful for oiling the transactions of Southeast Asian <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
Chinese and Arabs, by contrast, despite having been more advanced than Europe in navigation and shipping for so many centuries, had not even come close to pioneering the route around Africa in the opposite direction or discovering for the world the un<a href="know.htm">know</a>n continents of North and South America. The Portuguese' cleverly capitalized and <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ed ships carried out silver from Europe and <a href="gold.htm">gold</a> from West Africa, and returned a variety of goods such as spices that Europe craved. That such a small society could put so much <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y into such very risky enterprises -- and reap vast <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s in the process -- was completely unprecedented. The Portuguese, a century before just a tiny little country of sleepy fishing villages in an obscure corner of the world, in short order conquered the strategic points of Chinese, Indian, and Arab <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ing routes and became masters of the Oriental sea <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e. It was the most shocking development in world hi<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>y to date, and pioneered the way for other Europeans to follow.<br/>
