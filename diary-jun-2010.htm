One problem I see with <a href="back.htm">back</a>ing a <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency by labor *time* is the incentive it creates for <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers to 'milk' <a href="job.htm">job</a>s and to generally want to '<a href="protect.htm">protect</a>' <a href="job.htm">job</a>s from being fully solved or automated away.<br/>
<br/>
What I don't understand <small>(and a point that has been brought up by others - on the Oekonux list I think)</small> is that the auction described <small>(when including the weighting)</small> is <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly no <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> from letting "the market" decide how much a Consumer should <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> a <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>er.<br/>
<br/>
I <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> it is good to organize so Consumers and <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ers can 'connect', but I wonder if a sort of "bulletin board" where each person can list the goods and services they personally offer <small>(like "I have too many tomatoes" or "I <a href="know.htm">know</a> how to fix plumbing", etc.)</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;and also the goods and services they need <small>(like "I need tomatoes" or "I need a plumber")</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have not put quite enough <a href="work.htm">work</a> into the details of this...<br/>
<br/>
I'm also concerned about the "Central Planning" feel of having a software program <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e some of these decisions, though maybe I am just misunderstanding.<br/>
<br/>
Another problem for me is the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a of a "flat rate" <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>out of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed goods, but I don't have time right now to fully explain my concern.<br/>

<span class="quot">"'Which is preferable for man and for society, abundance or scarcity?<br/>
<br/>
"What!" people may exclaim.&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can there be any question about it?&nbsp;&nbsp;Has anyone ever suggested, or is it possible to maintain, that scarcity is the basis of man's well-being?"<br/>
<br/>
Yes, this has been suggested; yes, this has been maintained and is maintained every day, and I do not hesitate to say that the theory of scarcity is by far the most <a href="pop.htm">pop</a>ular of all theories.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the burden of conversations, <a href="new.htm">new</a>spaper <a href="art.htm">art</a>icles, books, and political <a href="speech.htm">speech</a>es; and, strange as it may seem, it is certain that political <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy will not have a completed its task and performed its practical function until it has <a href="pop.htm">pop</a>ularized and established as indisputable this very simple <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>osition: "Wealth consists in an abundance of commodities."<br/>
<br/>
Do we not hear it said every day: "Foreigners are going to flood us with their <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts"?&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, people fear abundance.<br/>
<br/>
Has not M. de Saint-Cricq said: "There is over<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion"?&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, he was afraid of abundance.<br/>
<br/>
Do not the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers wreck <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hines?&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, they are afraid of over<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, or--in other words--of abundance.<br/>
<br/>
Has not M. Bugeaud uttered these words: "Let bread be dear, and the farmer will be rich"?&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, bread can be dear only because it is scarce.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, M. Bugeaud was extolling scarcity.<br/>
<br/>
Has not M. d'Argout based his argument against the sugar industry on its very <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tivity?&nbsp;&nbsp;Has he not said again and again: "The sugar beet has no future, and its cultivation cannot be extended, because just a few hectares of sugar beets in each de<a href="part.htm">part</a>ment would be enough to supply all the consumers in France"?&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, as he sees things, good consists in barrenness and scarcity; and evil, in fertility and abundance.<br/>
<br/>
Do not La Presse, Le Commerce, and the majority of the daily <a href="new.htm">new</a>spapers publish one or more <a href="art.htm">art</a>icles every morning to prove to the Chambers and to the government that it is sound policy to legislate higher <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es for everything through manipulation of the tariff?&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not the Chambers and the government every day comply with this injunction from the press?&nbsp;&nbsp;But tariffs raise the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es of things only because they reduce their supply in the market!&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the <a href="new.htm">new</a>spapers, the Chambers, and the government put the theory of scarcity into practice, and I was right to say that this theory is by far the most <a href="pop.htm">pop</a>ular of all theories.<br/>

<span class="quot">> We socialized risk, but not reward.</span><br/>
<br/>
It is true that Capitalists do not 'socialize' reward, but that does not mean it cannot be done.<br/>
It is possible to organize afresh in such a way that reward <small>(<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> is treated <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ly.<br/>
<br/>
The treatment of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is usually pre-determined to be a <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment for those who have Invested.<br/>
But wait a minute, ... what if we could <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> Inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s directly with the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t instead?<br/>
<br/>
That would only be meaningful if the Inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s were simultaneously the Consumers of that very <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t, and if they only Invest as much as they predict they will need.<br/>
<br/>
So, for example, if a group of Milk Consumers organized to purchase a small dairy, they would prepay for the total <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, and their return for that Investment would the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t itself = Milk.<br/>
<br/>
There would be no <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> unless somebody accidentally Invested too much.&nbsp;&nbsp;And in that case, the extra milk could be sold, and considering the ridiculous over<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>ing of raw milk, it would be easy to charge a <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
But then what should the group do with that 'reward'?&nbsp;&nbsp;What would it mean to 'socialize' the <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>?<br/>
<br/>
Well, what if they acted as though the late-comer who paid that extra value were also <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing an investment?<br/>
<br/>
What if we treated <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as though it were an Investment from the Consumer who paid it?<br/>
<br/>
Doing so would taper <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> <small>(and therefore growth)</small> toward zero since a Consumer who <a href="own.htm">own</a>s the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t he <a href="use.htm">use</a>s does not <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> - for he <a href="own.htm">own</a>s the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t even before it is created as a side-effect of his having <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty in the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
This would cause the organization to grow according to Consumer demand <small>(<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> being the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e of that growth)</small>, in a 'distributed' manner since the very person willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for that growth becomes the direct beneficiary because he gains <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership and therefore control over those Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
And since a Consumer with <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty in Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s no <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> <small>(since he does not buy the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t, but <a href="own.htm">own</a>s it already)</small>, this also causes growth to naturally taper toward zero <small>[actually growth would follow the same curve as the demand for that <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t]</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> For now, all that can be done is to save and to wait.</span><br/>
<br/>
That sounds like no strategy at all.<br/>

<br/>
Not <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 2 main 'problems' with my approach:<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> I say Consumers should organize to purchase and <a href="own.htm">own</a> the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <small>(Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es)</small>, whereas most everyone else that is considering anything other than 'regular' Capitalism are sure the <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers must do this.&nbsp;&nbsp;When Consumers <a href="own.htm">own</a> the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of the things they need, they no longer buy those <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ectives, but <a href="own.htm">own</a> them already as a 'side-effect' of their <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.&nbsp;&nbsp;They must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s, including any Wages if they do not do all the <a href="work.htm">work</a> themselves, but they do not <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> because the final transaction of selling does not even occur since the outputs of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion are already in the '<a href="proper.htm">proper</a>' hands.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> I say <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> should be collected <small>(we should charge <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>)</small>, and yet also say we must treat that value as that <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er's investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very strange <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a to most people - so they usually don't want to spend the effort of thinking through the reasoning, otherwise they would see the profound effect this causes, for when Consumers <a href="own.htm">own</a> the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of the things they need, then <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e == <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> and <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> == 0 AND the Consumer is finally in full control of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.&nbsp;&nbsp;This also changes the entire goal of the organization from seeking <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> to seeking <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t.&nbsp;&nbsp;This change in direction is massive since the desire to keep <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> is what incents the <a href="art.htm">Art</a>ificial Scarcity and Purposeful Destruction in Capitalist and <a href="work.htm">Work</a>er <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ed orgs.<br/>

<span class="quot">> of programming it.</span><br/>
<br/>
Could you give me a concrete example of what you mean by "re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e allocation"?<br/>
<br/>
I have some <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>as about how to "allocate re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es" through auction,<br/>
but am not sure that is what you mean.<br/>
<br/>
Here is my concrete example:<br/>
<br/>
A single <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine can be shared among a finite number of people.&nbsp;&nbsp;As<br/>
the number of consumers attempting to utilize the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine increases,<br/>
at some point it will be impossible to fullfill those requests with a<br/>
single <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine.<br/>
<br/>
If the collective <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers have the time-sharing of that <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine setup<br/>
so that anyone wanting to <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> it are bidding against each other, then<br/>
more time slots can be filled.<br/>
<br/>
People that want to <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> close to '<a href="cost.htm">cost</a>', and are willing to lose some<br/>
sleep will <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> at 2am, while other people may be willing to "fight it<br/>
out" for a slot at 12 noon in a bid war.<br/>
<br/>
As the dueling bidders raise their <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e for that time slot, they<br/>
are *proving* that the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent number of <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hines cannot fill peak<br/>
demand, and - since that "<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" will be invested for the<br/>
winning bidder toward buying ANOTHER <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine <small>(because <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is being<br/>
treated as <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er investment)</small>, the 'system' should be self-stablizing<br/>
as those extra <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ments will be invested toward another <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine until<br/>
the number of <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hines is sufficient to cover the needs of that<br/>
community.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, each sub-community that develops around each of those<br/>
<a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hines can then secede from the whole if they decide to treat their<br/>
<a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine in a <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> manner <small>(say changing the oil more often)</small>.<br/>

Hey Dante,<br/>
<br/>
I like the <a class="ext" href="http://sharewiki.org/en/Leipzig_project">http://sharewiki.org/en/Leipzig_project</a> <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a.<br/>
<br/>
I've been <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing <small>(on paper)</small> on a larger-scale solution that meets the minimum requirements needed to allow us to '<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>' ourselves by utilizing our <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive outputs - eventually eliminating some of the reasons we <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently <a href="use.htm">use</a> <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y.<br/>
<br/>
Here are my rough thoughts so far:<br/>
<br/>
----<br/>
'Regular' <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y will probably be needed, especially at the <a href="start.htm">start</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;But as we become <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive, we can '<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>' ourselves from the value we create.&nbsp;&nbsp;So instead of trying to earn $10 to buy a meal, we avoid <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing the $10 by using Nature and tools to create the meal.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We should charge a <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> <small>(<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>)</small> against the uninvested, but we must treat that extra income as that <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er's investment into more <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of the type needed to supply another instance of the purchased <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ective.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will cause the <a href="new.htm">new</a>comer to also gain a foothold as we grow so he becomes an active <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the solution as a <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>er along with the rest of us.<br/>
<br/>

<hr/><span class="date">Jun-14-2010:</span> Some Problems with Cooperative Principles:<br/>
<br/>
<a class="ext" href="http://NCBA.coop/ncba/about-co-ops">NCBA.coop/ncba/about-co-ops</a><br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">"'<br/>
The International Cooperative Alliance has established seven Principles that define co-ops as <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the <a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>ement on the Co-operative <a href="ide.htm">Ide</a>ntity.<br/>
<br/>
1st Principle: Voluntary and Open Membership<br/>
<br/>
Co-operatives are voluntary organizations, open to all persons able to <a href="use.htm">use</a> their services and willing to accept the responsibilities of membership, without gender, social, racial, political or religious discrimination.<br/>
'"</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">"'<br/>
2nd Principle: Democratic Member Control<br/>
<br/>
Co-operatives are democratic organizations controlled by their members, who actively <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipate in setting their policies and <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing decisions. Men and women serving as elected representatives are accountable to the membership. In primary co-operatives members have equal voting rights <small>(one member, one vote)</small> and co-operatives at other levels are also organized in a democratic manner.<br/>
'"</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">"'<br/>
3rd Principle: Member <a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omic <a href="part.htm">Part</a>icipation<br/>
<br/>
Members contribute equitably to, and democratically control, the capital of their co-operative. At least <a href="part.htm">part</a> of that capital is usually the common <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of the co-operative. Members usually receive limited compensation, if any, on capital subscribed as a condition of membership. Members allocate surpluses for any or all of the following purposes: developing their co-operative, possibly by setting up reserves, <a href="part.htm">part</a> of which at least would be indivisible; benefiting members in <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ortion to their transactions with the co-operative; and supporting other activities approved by the membership.<br/>
'"</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">"'<br/>
4th Principle: Autonomy and Independence<br/>
<br/>
Co-operatives are autonomous, self-help organizations controlled by their members. If they enter to <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ments with other organizations, including governments, or raise capital from external <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, they do so on terms that ensure democratic control by their members and maintain their co-operative autonomy.<br/>
'"</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">"'<br/>
5th Principle: Education, Training and Information<br/>
<br/>
Co-operatives provide education and training for their members, elected representatives, managers, and <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ees so they can contribute effectively to the development of their co-operatives. They inform the public - <a href="part.htm">part</a>icularly young people and opinion leaders - about the nature and benefits of co-operation.<br/>
'"</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">"'<br/>
6th Principle: Co-operation among Co-operatives<br/>
<br/>
Co-operatives serve their members most effectively and strengthen the co-operative movement by <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing together through local, national, regional and international structures.<br/>
'"</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">"'<br/>
7th Principle: Concern for Community<br/>
<br/>
Co-operatives <a href="work.htm">work</a> for the sustainable development of their communities through policies approved by their members.<br/>
Bookmark and Share<br/>

Tyranny of the Majority<br/>
<br/>
The "one member, one vote" principle is similar to the "opt-out" problem caused when <a href="user.htm">user</a>s pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> into a slush-<a href="fund.htm">fund</a> controlled by a committee.<br/>

It thereby helps to reduce the problems imposed by counterfeiting and <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t privacy.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">"'<br/>
An important <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>ding block is the duality of existence, in the physical and the <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual world, for the secure authentication of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts. The technological foundation is RFID <small>(Radio Frequency <a href="ide.htm">Ide</a>ntification)</small>, which allows secure tagging, reliable and easy-to-<a href="use.htm">use</a> <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>ntification, and dynamic authentication. The RFID label itself serves both as a security feature and as a bridge between the physical and the <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual, i.e. digital, world.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ective of the SToP project is to create a solution for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t authentication, which satisfies a complex set of requirements. The solution must be secure, meaning that tags are <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ed against manipulations and they must not be cloneable. Security is further supported through the tracking capabilities provided by RFID. It must be <a href="user.htm">user</a>-friendly and <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>-effective, being usable by a wide range of <a href="part.htm">part</a>ies such as manufacturers, vendors, customs authorities, and consumers. This helps to detect counterfeit goods as early as possible or even prevent them from entering into the supply chain in the first place. As a <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>-based solution, it supports the alignment and information of stakeholders. It encourages information sharing on counterfeiting related problems and promotes closer cooperation. It improves communication with consumers, providing them with better ways of risk mitigation and education.<br/>

As this discussion continues I will need show why we must treat <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> more carefully than just hoping it doesn't exist.&nbsp;&nbsp;But that is usually a <a href="part.htm">part</a>y killer, so will wait until it is necessary.<br/>

What I'm suggesting is mostly the same <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a as "Customer <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ed <a href="net.htm">Net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>s", but general enough to be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d in all types of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>

Here are some references to what others have to say about this <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>el.<br/>
<br/>
''According to Metcalfe's Law, the value of an internet connection rises with the number of <a href="user.htm">user</a>s on the <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>. However, the phone companies do not get to raise their <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es in return for that increase in value. This is a matter of considerable frustration to them.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic logic of the market suggests that capital should be invested by whoever captures the value of the investment. The telephone companies are using that argument to suggest that they should either be given monopoly <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>ing power over the last mile, or that they should be allowed to vertically integrate content with conduit. Either strategy would allow them to raise <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es by locking out the competition, thus <a href="restor.htm">restor</a>ing their coercive power over the customer and helping them extract <a href="new.htm">new</a> revenues from their internet subscribers.'' -- <a class="ext" href="http://Shirky.com/writings/zapmail.html">http://Shirky.com/writings/zapmail.html</a><br/>

Yes, yes, I am very interested in this too.&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we share Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es?...<br/>
<br/>
And how can we share without accidentally becoming one of the same beasts we <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently fight <small>(facebook, Google, etc.)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
We need a detailed description of what to do and what not to do at each step so we can finally create a business <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el that is better than *either* of Capitalism or Corporatism.<br/>
<br/>
This "Code of Conduct" would be a legal document that members of any group could apply to any material assets they intend to share.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But we will need to simplify our analysis to find what we have been doing wrong and how to correct it.<br/>
<br/>
So let's <a href="start.htm">start</a> with just 2 people and see what we can discover:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> We can keep the <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s without ever spending them!</span><br/>
<br/>
Hmm... If 2 people are sharing some tangible <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect <small>(say a <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter)</small>, is there such a thing as <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>?<br/>
<br/>
The 2 people must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s to purchase, <a href="install.htm">install</a>, maintain, etc. the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine.<br/>
<br/>
But I don't think they <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> - for who would they <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> it to?<br/>
<br/>
Also, they do not 'earn' <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, but are instead paid in '<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t'.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their ROI is the very output of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, they are <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing and <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing for <a href="use.htm">Use</a>-Value alone.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ahhh, but if a 3rd person appears that does not yet have <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, we can charge him more than <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s and thereby extract <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Now, he could have avoided <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> if he just had the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership needed to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> him...<br/>
<br/>
So if he could gain some <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of his <a href="own.htm">own</a> - let's say we <a href="use.htm">use</a>d some of that <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> he just paid toward the purchase of another <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter that he and other late-comers would eventually <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Treating <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er's investment creates a negative-feed<a href="back.htm">back</a> loop that auto-levels re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e allocation <small>(growth only occurs during overbidding, and overbidding only occurs when growth is truly needed)</small>, distributes control to those who are willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for it <small>(in the end those who are willing to <a href="work.htm">work</a> for it)</small>, and safely drives <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> toward 0 while also creating a basis for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion withou fear of automation or un<a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ment.<br/>

<hr/><span class="date">Jun-01-2010:</span> The definition of a "Consumers' Cooperative" shows the consumers do not have <a href="real.htm">real</a>, final <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership and are not in full control, but have forfeited those rights to a committee that runs the organization largely the same as a for-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> corporation.<br/>
<br/>
<a class="ext" href="http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumers%27_cooperative">Wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumers%27_cooperative</a> tells us: <span class="quot">"'Every year members receive a share of the <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s that they helped to create, based on the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> made in <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s that year and the how much they had spent with any of its businesses.'"</span><br/>
<br/>
But <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> only occurs if the consumer is buying goods from an <a href="own.htm">own</a>er at some <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
So why are these consumers buying those goods?&nbsp;&nbsp;Aren't they the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers already?<br/>
<br/>
A cooperative operating by the "Rochdale Principles" removes the connection between the Consumer and the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of their needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;This <small>(ignorantly or insidiously)</small> <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>es exchange, and therefore <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, is perpetuated.<br/>
<br/>
Under the system of <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty<a href="left.htm">Left</a>, <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> tapers toward zero as <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty is distributed, and <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty is distributed each time a Consumer <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> because that overpayment is invested *for* the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er in more <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es that finally become his <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
Cooperatives are operated in a 'Democratic' manner with one vote per person, no matter how that person has invested.<br/>
<br/>
This is very <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> from how sharing <a href="work.htm">work</a>s between individuals or in very small club.<br/>
<br/>
Usually <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ing goods occurs when the consumer has insufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion - for when his <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is sufficient, he does not 'buy' apples, but instead <a href="own.htm">own</a>s them already as a result of his <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the trees and pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <small>(with Wages being one of those <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
A cooperative suffers the "Tyranny of the Majority" compliance because fees/taxes collected into a slush-<a href="fund.htm">fund</a> and then doled out by a committee-<a href="admin.htm">admin</a>istered entity<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> A CCC is not an <a href="admin.htm">admin</a>istrative entity and has no defined committee, but is merely an observation that many independent <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers using the CCCC may choose to <a href="work.htm">work</a> together for the benefits it brings.&nbsp;&nbsp;We define a CCC only for the purpose of easily talking about such groups of <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers, but that cooperation is neither mandatory nor centrally managed.&nbsp;&nbsp;The CCCC may even need a clause to help keep otherwise independent groups from being coerced into <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipating in governance or being drawn into clustering policies which some personalities will likely want to inflict during later stages of development.<br/>
<br/>
It is now clear to me how misleading it is to utilize the term 'cooperative' since that word is <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itionally envisioned as an overarching entity of control instead of the loosely connected independent groups of <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers which the CCCC would foster.<br/>

<span class="h2">==<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership of the outputs</span><br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> A CC entity <a href="own.htm">own</a>s the outputs of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and sells those goods <a href="back.htm">back</a> to each individual consumer/<a href="own.htm">own</a>er - causing <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> even if consumer/<a href="own.htm">own</a>er had sufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership to have been the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of those goods already.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> When using the CCCC, the individual <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of each individual Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e is the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of the ouputs of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, so goods are not sold unless the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er decides he has an 'excess' and chooses to do so - but in that case <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> must be treated as an investment from the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> A CC may have arbitrary conditions of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership applied homogenously to all Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es across the entire cooperative such as <span class="quot">"'Membership is open to everyone as long as they share the Group's values and principles.'"</span> <small>[ <a class="ext" href="http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Co-operative_Group">Wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Co-operative_Group</a> ]</small><br/>

<span class="bullet">*</span> The CCCC has only one condition of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership: If the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of an <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect under the CCCC choose to sell, give, <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>, <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e, share, <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agate or convey that <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect - any <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> must be retained by the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er as a receipt of investment in more <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.&nbsp;&nbsp;This investment is <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently <a href="know.htm">know</a>n as a <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t Future.<br/>

<span class="bullet">*</span> The CCCC is a <a href="trad.htm">Trad</a>e <a href="agree.htm">Agree</a>ment that requires <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> be treated as an investment from the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er so that latecomers gain <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty in <a href="new.htm">new</a> Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es at the rate they are willing and able to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> A CC is supposedly 'democratic' in that each member has one vote over the operation of the *entire* cooperative no matter the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> they have invested.&nbsp;&nbsp;This has Tyranny of the Majority problems, gives <a href="new.htm">new</a>comers too much weight compared to more established members and will probably lead to 'representative' governance.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> The CCCC creates extremely localized governance because it is applied solely by the <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers of each indivisible Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only mandatory laws are embodied within the CCCC and enforced by the private-<a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty laws of the 'containing' city, <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e and nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers using the CCCC might enforce extra restrictions upon the <a href="use.htm">use</a>, <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ification, copying and sharing of their physical <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty instances as long as those restrictions do not violate the CCCC.<br/>

This attempts to solve problems caused by the misapplication of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> through a reduction in divisibility.<br/>
