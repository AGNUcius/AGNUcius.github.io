&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es Should Be <a href="free.htm">Free</a><br/>
<br/>
<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es are the means to an end.&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of spaghetti include: <a href="land.htm">land</a>, water, seed, energy, compost, tools to <small>{till, sow, reap, grind, mix, press, boil, strain}</small>, plate, fork, salt.<br/>
<br/>
A <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e is recursively defined as either:<br/>
&nbsp; The <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t of other <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es<br/>
OR<br/>
&nbsp; A finite <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
So, while a tiller is one of the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of spaghetti, it also has it's <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es:<br/>
<span class="bullet">:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiller: Metal, plastic, tools to shape the metal and plastic, energy, design, plans to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e it all come together; gasoline, anir and oil to run it, etc.<br/>
<span class="bullet">:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Metal: Mined ore, tools to smelter, forge, energy, etc.<br/>
<span class="bullet">:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mined Ore: Ore, <a href="know.htm">know</a>ledge or magic to find it, tools to mine it, energy, etc.<br/>
<span class="bullet">:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ore: Finite<br/>
<span class="bullet">:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Plastic: Extracted Petrol, Other components of platic, tools to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e the liquid, energy, action<br/>

<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es contribute to the world by <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing it possible to copy and <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects.&nbsp;&nbsp;Permaculture, better design and automation <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>e to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e this easier for all of us.<br/>
<br/>
Not everyone wants it to be easier.&nbsp;&nbsp;The system of <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty rights allows ``<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers'' to withhold potential benefit from the rest of the public.&nbsp;&nbsp;They would like to be the only ones who can copy and <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts we <a href="use.htm">use</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;They can do this when <a href="user.htm">user</a>s do not control some <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es for that kind of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty rights are important for privacy, but they have been mixed together with <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty wrongs.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is wrong to take <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom away from <a href="user.htm">user</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;An ordinary <a href="user.htm">user</a>, who does not <a href="own.htm">own</a> the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of an <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect, can try to copy the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t "by hand", but it is not <a href="free.htm">free</a> to utilize <small>(as a <a href="work.htm">work</a>er)</small> the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <small>(<a href="buil.htm">buil</a>dings, tools, etc.)</small> needed to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e another <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect of that kind, or to fix or change the intance in question.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some laws, such as DMCA <small>(and other various incarnations)</small> disallow copying the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t in this manner, studying, or even just understanding how it <a href="work.htm">work</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, intelligence is illegal.&nbsp;&nbsp;With physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es there is the complexity of <a href="real.htm">real</a> and re<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ing <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s that must be covered for the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e to remain viable, so it may not sound reasonable to think <a href="hard.htm">hard</a> <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es could also be <a href="free.htm">free</a>, but remember it's about <a href="lib.htm">lib</a>erty, not <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="curr.htm">Curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers can safely share physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es by charging <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> high enough to cover those <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> In September 1999, Bolivian officials signed a 40-year contract with a private company named Aguas del Tunari to take over the municipal water system of Cochabamba, the country's third largest city. The company, largely <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by U.S. construction giant Bechtel, was the sole bidder for the contract, which guaranteed 15 percent annual <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> in inflation-indexed dollars.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> With the encouragement of the International <a href="mone.htm">Mone</a>tary <a href="fund.htm">Fund</a> <small>(IMF)</small> and the World <a href="bank.htm">Bank</a>, since 1985 Bolivian governments have sold national public assets to foreign inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s and opened their markets to global <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e. Despite the <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>e of development by following the "Washington consensus" of <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic <a href="lib.htm">lib</a>eralization, it remained the poorest country in Latin America. But World <a href="bank.htm">Bank</a> officials still insisted that Bolivia privatize Cochabamba's water utility and that residents, no matter how poor, <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> full <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of the service without subsidy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Two months after Bechtel's subsi<a href="diary.htm">diary</a> took over, it roughly tripled local water rates, telling the poor they could <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> one-fourth of their income for water or have the spigot shut off. There were massive protests for several months until the contract was cancelled.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> But a few months after signing the contract, Bechtel surreptitiously added new inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s and reincorporated its subsi<a href="diary.htm">diary</a> in the <a href="net.htm">Net</a>her<a href="land.htm">land</a>s. When it lost the contract, Bechtel sued Bolivia---under terms of a bilateral investment treaty between Bolivia and <a href="net.htm">Net</a>her<a href="land.htm">land</a>s---for damages of at least $25 million for loss of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s it might have made, even though it had invested less than $1 million. Last month, the Bolivian government argued in secret hearings before an investment tribunal affiliated with the World <a href="bank.htm">Bank</a> that the treaty doesn't apply, <a href="part.htm">part</a>ly because Dutch nationals never controlled Aguas del Tunari.<br/>
<br/>
These practices resemble those now <a href="use.htm">use</a>d throughout the world, where every <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t has a guard over the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e to prevent forbidden access, and where individuals have to raise organisms and copy <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts secretly, <a href="pass.htm">pass</a>ing them from hand to hand as ``samizdat''.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is little <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence: the motive for control world wide is political, but since corporations run governments, we see the final the motive is <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is the actions that affect us, not the motive.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any attempt to block the sharing of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts, no matter why, leads to the same methods and the same harshness.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e several kinds of arguments for giving them the power to control how we share:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Name calling.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers <a href="use.htm">use</a> smear words such as ``piracy'' and ``theft'', as well as expert terminology such as ``intellectual <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty'' and ``damage'', to suggest a certain line of thinking to the public---a simplistic analogy between <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es and the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect of those <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>as and intuitions about <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty for an <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect are about whether it is right to take an <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect away from someone else.&nbsp;&nbsp;They don't directly apply to pragmatic sharing or re<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <small>(sharing of <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers ask us to apply them anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Exaggeration.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers say that they suffer ``harm'' or ``<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic loss'' when <a href="user.htm">user</a>s have access to their <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the access has no direct effect on the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er, and it harms no one.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="own.htm">own</a>er can lose only if the person who <a href="use.htm">use</a>d the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e would otherwise have paid the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er some <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A little thought shows that most such people would not have wanted to endure such usury.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>te their ``losses'' as if each and every one would have submitted willfully.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is exaggeration---to put it kindly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> The law.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers often describe the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e of the law, and the harsh penalties they can threaten us with.&nbsp;&nbsp;Implicit in this approach is the suggestion that today's law reflects an unquestionable view of morality---yet at the same time, we are urged to regard these penalties as facts of nature that can't be blamed on anyone.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This line of persuasion isn't designed to stand up to critical thinking; it's intended to reinforce a habitual mental pathway.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's elementary that laws don't decide right and wrong. Every American should <a href="know.htm">know</a> that, forty years ago, it was against the law in many <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>es for a black person to sit in the front of a bus; but only racists would say sitting there was wrong.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Natural rights.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers often claim a special connection with <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es they <a href="own.htm">own</a>, and go on to assert that, as a result, their desires and interests concerning the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e simply outweigh those of anyone else---or even those of the whole rest of the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>(Typically companies, not <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers, hold <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, but we are expected to ignore this discrepancy.)</small><br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To those who <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ose this as an ethical axiom---the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er is more important than you---I can only say that I, an <a href="own.htm">own</a>er myself, call it bunk.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But people in general are only likely to feel any sympathy with the natural rights claims for two reasons.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One reason is an understretched analogy with material <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I cook spaghetti, I do <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect if someone else eats it, because then I cannot eat it.&nbsp;&nbsp;His action hurts me exactly as much as it benefits him; only one of us can eat the spaghetti, so the question is, which?&nbsp;&nbsp;The smallest distinction between us is enough to tip the ethical balance.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But whether you have <a href="free.htm">free</a> access to the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of spaghetti affects you directly and me only indirectly.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h4">====Some <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s include:</span><br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span> Holding <small>(rivalry)</small>:<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>. Durables such as the pan, stove, plate, fork are temporarily exclusive, so could be <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ed.<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>. Consumables such as fuel, spaghetti, water, salt, oil are irreversibly transformed, so should by paid for in full.<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span> Investment: Interest <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ments and <a href="install.htm">install</a>ation for the <a href="land.htm">land</a>, <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>ding and tools.<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span> Energy: Fuel for stove, lighting, fuel for hot-water during cleanup.<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span> Maintainence: Washing the pans, fixing the stove.<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span> Pollution: Noise, bother, smell, mess.<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span> Wages: If you want or need someone else to cook for you.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether you give a copy of some spaghetti to your friend, or teach him how to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for the <a href="use.htm">use</a> of the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es affects you and your friend much more than it affects me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I shouldn't have the power to tell you not to do these things.&nbsp;&nbsp;No one should.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>d reason is that people have been told that natural wrongs for <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers is the accepted and unquestioned <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ition of our society.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a matter of hi<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>y, the opposite is true. The <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a of natural wrongs of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers is recognized by many leaders such as: Christ, Ghandi, George, <a href="stallman.htm">Stallman</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;That's why the Constitution only permits hoarding and does not require it; that's why it should be temporary for some things.&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is to promote progress --- not to reward hoarders.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <a href="real.htm">real</a> established <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ition of our society is that hoarding cuts into the natural rights of the public --- and that this can only be justified for the public's sake.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> <a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omics.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final argument made for <a href="own.htm">own</a>er hoarding is that this leads to more <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike the others, this argument at least takes a legitimate approach to the subject.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is based on a valid goal --- satisfying the consumer.&nbsp;&nbsp;And it is empirically clear that people will <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e more of something if they are well paid for doing so.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic argument has a flaw: it is based on the assumption that the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence is only a matter of how much <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y we have to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;It assumes that ``<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion'' is what we want, whether the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers can hoard or not.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People readily accept this assumption because it appears to accord with our experiences with material <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects.&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider a sandwich, for instance.&nbsp;&nbsp;You might well be able to get an equivalent sandwich either <a href="free.htm">free</a> or for a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;If so, the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> you <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> is one <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether or not you have to buy it, the sandwich has the same taste, the same nutritional value, and in either case you can only eat it once.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether you get the sandwich from an <a href="own.htm">own</a>er or not directly affects the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y you have afterwards and also determines whether you will have the <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom to access the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of that sandwich so you may <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify, copy and share copies of it.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is true for any kind of material <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect---whether or not it has an <a href="own.htm">own</a>er may directly affect what it is, and what you can do with it if you acquire it.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If such an <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect is locked closed, this very much affects what it is, and what you can do with a copy if you buy one.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence is not just a matter of <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty system encourages <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e something---but not what society <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;And it causes intangible ethical pollution that affects us all.<br/>
<br/>
What does society need?&nbsp;&nbsp;It needs <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects that are truly available to its citizens---for example, <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hines that people can study, fix, adapt, and improve, not just operate as an <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ee.&nbsp;&nbsp;But what <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers typically deliver is a black box that we can't <a href="use.htm">use</a>, <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify, copy or change in the most inventive of ways.<br/>
<br/>
Society also needs <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom.&nbsp;&nbsp;When an <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect is locked closed, the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s lose <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom to control <a href="part.htm">part</a> of their <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
And above all society needs to encourage the spirit of voluntary cooperation in its citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp;When <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers tell us that helping our neighbors in a natural way is ``piracy'', they pollute our society's civic spirit.<br/>
<br/>
This is why we say that <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects are a matter of <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom, not <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic argument for <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers is erroneous, but the <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic issue is <a href="real.htm">real</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people create or purchase for pleasure or for admiration and love; but if we want more <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects and <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es than those people can afford, we need to raise <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
The Personal Sovereignty Foundation <small>(PSF)</small>, a tax-exempt charity for <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect development, raises <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s by selling <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects which <a href="user.htm">user</a>s are <a href="free.htm">free</a> to <a href="use.htm">use</a>, <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify, copy and change, as well as from donations.<br/>
<br/>
Some <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect developers <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y by selling support services.<br/>
<br/>
As a consumer today, you may find yourself using a <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>rietary <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect.&nbsp;&nbsp;If your friend asks to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e a copy, it would be wrong to refuse, but it is impossible without access to the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooperation is more important than hoarding.&nbsp;&nbsp;But underground, closet cooperation does not <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e for a good society, and is usually impossible without access to the expensive <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;A person should aspire to <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>e an upright life openly with pride, and this means saying ``No'' to <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>rietary <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects.<br/>
<br/>
You deserve to be able to cooperate openly and <a href="free.htm">free</a>ly with other people who <a href="use.htm">use</a> <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects.&nbsp;&nbsp;You deserve to be able to learn how the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect <a href="work.htm">work</a>s, and to teach your students with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;You deserve to be able to hire your favorite <a href="art.htm">art</a>isan to fix it when it breaks.<br/>
<br/>
You deserve <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects, and <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects require <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.<br/>
