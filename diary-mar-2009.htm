<br/>
<br/>
It's funny, I do feel as though I'm wandering in the abyss...<br/>
<br/>
I must have assumed too much in my original question.<br/>
<br/>
Many responses seem to say we are not failing.<br/>
<br/>
I think there are flaws in how we organize,<br/>
<br/>
And I think we can 'solve' those flaws,<br/>
<br/>
But only if we admit they exist.<br/>
<br/>
Then we can talk strategy.<br/>
<br/>
To solve 'we' <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
For security.<br/>
<br/>
Together<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, if we don't learn how to share physical <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, every individual will be required to do every type of <a href="work.htm">work</a> for themselves, even if they don't have those <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s or the <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>dings, organisms, energy, tools etc. needed for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Almost nobody I <a href="know.htm">know</a> can even afford to <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="land.htm">land</a> and water rights.<br/>
Almost every person I <a href="know.htm">know</a> owes their house to the <a href="bank.htm">bank</a> through a Mort Gage = Death Grip.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It seems we might be better off crash-<a href="land.htm">land</a>ing on another planet or a deserted is<a href="land.htm">land</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Could we each afford to <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d a hut if there were only as many as are subscribed to <a class="ext" href="http://UrbanEvolution.org?">UrbanEvolution.org?</a><br/>
<br/>
I don't <a href="know.htm">know</a> how it can be claimed the 'we' are not failing when there is so much preventable poverty, homelessness, starvation, etc. among the very persons <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing the <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>est because they are unable to afford any <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>

<br/>
Hello all.<br/>
<br/>
My question is small, but the answer is likely not...<br/>
<br/>
What I want to <a href="know.htm">know</a> is why humans tend to always fail when they try to organize - leaving each of us attempting to do everything alone.<br/>
<br/>
Why do our efforts go 'astray' as the size of each group grows? Why do our efforts not scale?<br/>
<br/>
If Capitalism is wrong, what *specifically* is wrong with it, and can if be fixed?<br/>
<br/>
I'm not suggesting <a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>e-run Communism as an alternative. That appa<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ly doesn't <a href="work.htm">work</a> either.<br/>
<br/>
But could we ever figure-out the 'bug' with our organizational <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s that keep us from creating community, or will we be forever confined to solitude for basic survival while simultaneously being semi-forced to <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipate in the problematic corporate world?<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>

<span class="quot">"'<a href="co-own.htm">Co-Own</a>ed Public Peer <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty'"</span><br/>
<br/>
When I say "<a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership" I am talking about some group choosing to invest and hold some physical <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty for their <a href="own.htm">own</a> benefit.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm NOT talking about every human on Earth having a say in that investment - only those who paid would have a say <small>(a vote)</small>, and that vote would naturally be weighted by the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership they paid for.<br/>
<br/>
Some examples that already occur:<br/>
1.)</small> Some people joint-purchase an RV <small>(Motor Home)</small> so they can <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> only <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> People <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> vacation homes before the Time-Share industry organized to take that over for the purpose of charging more than <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
3.)</small> Co-purchasing an airplane allows the group of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers to share it amongst themselves - hiring a pilot to operate it if necessary, but <a href="real.htm">real</a>izing great savings compared to <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>al.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="co-own.htm">Co-own</a>ership allows each of us to invest in industry that would otherwise be out of reach because of financial constraints.<br/>
<br/>
The capitalists are already using the strength of <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership against us when the joint-invest in for-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> corporations.<br/>
<br/>
Without <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership we will be forced to do everything on our <a href="own.htm">own</a>, without any in<a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ependence.<br/>
<br/>
The Capitalists will infiltrate any community we try to establish - just as they <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently do - when they buy the <a href="land.htm">land</a>, water rights, <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>s, restaurants, meeting places, grocery <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>es, shopping malls, farms, factories, etc. that are more efficiently <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by more than one person.<br/>
<br/>
Once they <a href="own.htm">own</a> that infrastructure, and if we are not "pushing against it" by organizing and <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ing for ourselves, then we will be overrun as usual.<br/>
<br/>
Single-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is important for Personal <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, but for as long as we continue to resist solving the problems of <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership, we will be at the mercy of those that <a href="use.htm">use</a> it against us.<br/>
