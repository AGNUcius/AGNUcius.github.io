<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers of <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty held public must receive <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> from <a href="user.htm">user</a>s as compensation for <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s, including the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult to <a href="calc.htm">calc</a>ulate <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of exclusion.<br/>
<br/>
In the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> Society, <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> is treated as <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er investment.<br/>

We might taper the <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>-cycle from the outskirts a city toward focal points - so that <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>dings, performance stages, showers, restaurant grills, smoothie <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hines, bowling lanes, <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter equipment, car garages, etc. at these hot-spots would be leased for very short periods of time - maybe even just 1 minute intervals - so that <a href="art.htm">art</a>ists may be a jack of any <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e whenever qualified.<br/>
<br/>
Short intervals are not ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riate for everyone or everything, so the <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>-cycles would be longer the further from these centers.<br/>

A <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>er must hold enough <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance points to cover the predicted <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of misuse.<br/>
<br/>
For example:<br/>
# A homeless drifter wanders into town.<br/>
# He is attracted to a sign-post advertising <a href="job.htm">job</a>s.<br/>
# <a href="employ.htm">Employ</a>ment involving low-<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> tools in public areas such as sweeping and shoveling may require 0 points of <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance.<br/>
# He chooses a <a href="job.htm">job</a> load and contacts the <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>er.<br/>
# He earns the points <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>ed - but only if the <a href="job.htm">job</a> is done correctly <small>(how is this determined?)</small><br/>
# Let's say he did a great <a href="job.htm">job</a> and earned 100 points that day.<br/>
# He <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>s a shower stall at 2 points/hr and buys water at 0.1 point/gallon, and <a href="soap.htm">soap</a>, towel etc., all at '<a href="cost.htm">cost</a>' unless there is more demand than supply*.<br/>
# He then goes to dinner which <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s 5 points, and <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>s a motel for 5 points.<br/>
# In the morning he still has about 80 points, so can choose to do <a href="work.htm">work</a> that requires at least that much <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance, or can just spend those points.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> When demand is more than supply, <a href="user.htm">user</a>s <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> as usual, but that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is treated as an investment in more physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es for that same <a href="user.htm">user</a>.<br/>

<span class="quot">"'Karl Marx <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>d with Henry George and with the classical <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists that this <a href="land.htm">land</a>-<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> was a form of exploitation. <a href="land.htm">Land</a>-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers were able to get "something for nothing" just because they controlled such important natural re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es. To Marx, the <a href="land.htm">land</a>-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers received a <a href="part.htm">part</a> of capitalist society's surplus-value that was redistributed from the industrial <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>or, where <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed it. However, unlike other <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists, Marx also saw industrial capitalists as <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>iers who simply extracted <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic surplus from labor, while otherwise contributing nothing to the <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy.<br/>
<br/>
Returns to sunk <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> investments in specialized capital equipment do have some of the same qualities as <a href="land.htm">land</a> <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>, in that, once the sunk <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> investment in specialized equipment is made, the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e necessary to bring the capital equipment into the <a href="use.htm">use</a> for which it was designed may be much less than would be necessary to repay the original <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of investment. The <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> necessary to bring a sunk <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> investment into <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive <a href="use.htm">use</a> and the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> actually earned has been termed a quasi-<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>. It is not a true <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>, because there would have to be an expectation of <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic return in order to induce the original investment; and, if the investment was not repaid, the specialized asset may be allowed to wear out, without repair or replenishment, in such <a href="use.htm">use</a> as could be obtained. Nevertheless, the existence of quasi-<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>s can create paradoxical situations. A railroad, for example, consists of large, sunk <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> investments in right-of-way, rail and rolling <a href="stock.htm">stock</a>, with the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ective of being able to transport people or goods at a very low variable <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>. The alternative <a href="use.htm">use</a>s of the specialized capital <a href="stock.htm">stock</a> of a railroad, for other than railroading, are, typically, few and poor. Once the sunk <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> investment is made, it is in the interest of the railroad to accept shipments at rates, which cover the low variable <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>, even when the rate does not offer an adequate return on the sunk <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> investment in right-of-way, rail and rolling <a href="stock.htm">stock</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>ern neoclassical <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omics has generalized the concept of <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> to suggest that the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of any kind of input can receive income for that input, in excess of what is necessary to put the factor into a <a href="part.htm">part</a>icular <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive <a href="use.htm">use</a>. The <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>, in this conception, is the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between what is paid and the opportunity <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>, represented by the income available in the next, best <a href="use.htm">use</a> of the factor.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="rent.htm">Rent</a> can be viewed as an estimate of how much market <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es for an input would have to change, before the allocation of that <a href="part.htm">part</a>icular input would change. How much would the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e of maize have to fall relative other crops, before a given field would be planted in rice or potatoes or alfalfa or some other crop instead of maize? A field <a href="part.htm">part</a>icularly well-suited to maize, but not other crops, could be said to be earning a <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> as a maize field, to the extent that the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> actually earned as a maize field exceeded the absolute minimum a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> necessary to allocate the field to maize, as opposed to its next best <a href="use.htm">use</a>, i.e. its opportunity <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
As another example, an excellent professional basketball player typically earns much more income than is necessary to compensate him or her for the training, effort, practice, and the like needed to become a player. In the presence of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tivity enhancing effects of large <a href="arena.htm">arena</a>s and television broadcasting, which allow team <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers to sell the right to view <a href="game.htm">game</a>s to very large numbers of customers, a few highly talented basketball players compete for a relatively few, highly compensated slots on pro teams. The <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between the minimum a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y putatively needed to get a Michael Jordan to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e the human capital investment into becoming such an excellent player <small>(adjusted for probability and risk aversion)</small>, and the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> actually paid Michael Jordan to play for the Chicago Bulls, may be termed a <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The generalization of the concept of <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> to include quasi-<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>s and returns above opportunity <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> has served to highlight the role of barriers to competition in determining and creating <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>s. A person seeking to become a medical doctor <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es a huge sunk <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> investment in medical training and education, which has limited potential application outside of medical practice. In a competitive market for medical services, a doctor's wages would be bid down, until the expected <a href="net.htm">net</a> return on the sunk <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> investment in training would be near zero, that is, barely enough to justify <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing the investment. In a sense, the required investment becomes a barrier to entry, discouraging would-be doctors from <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing the necessary investment in training to enter the competitive market for medical services, when the return on the necessary sunk <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> investment is competed away. Restrictions on the numbers of people entering into the competitive market for medical services, however, would have the effect of raising the return on investments in medical training, without increasing the number of entrants to the market. Associations of doctors have been <a href="know.htm">know</a>n to lobby government to limit, in various ways, the number of medical schools training medical doctors and the number of medical students at those institutions. This kind of political activity is sometimes termed <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>-seeking, though the returns <a href="real.htm">real</a>ized from such political activities might be more akin to monopoly <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s than <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>s, as generally conceived. Monopoly <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s are sometimes called monopoly <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>s.<br/>

Two types of factor <a href="rent.htm">rent</a><br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Classical factor <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> -- This is the return to a factor above and beyond the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> necessary to induce the supplier to offer the input to the market. This corresponds to the notion of a <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers' surplus or "scarcity <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>." This type of <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> arises because of scarcity in the supply of inputs. If factor supply is perfectly elastic, there would be no <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers' surplus and no <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Paretian factor <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> - This is the return to a factor above and beyond the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> that the factor supplier would receive in its next-best alternative <a href="use.htm">use</a>. This type of <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> draws on the notion of opportunity <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s. For example, if someone is earning $20,000 for a <a href="job.htm">job</a>, and the next best <a href="job.htm">job</a> <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s $15,000, then the <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> is the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between the two: $5,000.<br/>
