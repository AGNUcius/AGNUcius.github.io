<span class="quot">> you'll have to clarify this magic value.&nbsp;&nbsp;All the dollars go</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> somewhere, and thus everything is a "<a href="cost.htm">cost</a>".</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi Permafacture,<br/>
<br/>
I understand a <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er sees <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as a <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>, but I'm talking about the '<a href="pop.htm">pop</a>ular' definition of these terms that are written from the point-of-view of the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers of the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<a class="ext" href="http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost">http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost</a> says <span class="quot">"'Usually, the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e also includes a mark-up for <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> over the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.'"</span><br/>
<br/>
So, to avoid confusion, I will stop using these bare terms, and instead prepend an '<a href="ide.htm">ide</a>ntifier' that will keep our thinking more clear.<br/>
<br/>
The following relations are equivalent:<br/>
<br/>
<a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er_<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e == <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s + <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a><br/>
<a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> == <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er_<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e - <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s<br/>
<a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s == <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er_<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e - <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is not an <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, it is the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers receive ABOVE the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the <a href="diff.htm">DIFF</a>ERENCE between <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er_<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e and <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
From the <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er's point-of-view, once the transaction is made, a <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er's_<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e paid becomes his <a href="own.htm">own</a> "<a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>", even though it also contains <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>s paid to those other <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
For example:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Say the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er of a "pin factory" buys steel as an input of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.&nbsp;&nbsp;He will <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> a <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er_<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e which includes both <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s AND <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, but from HIS point-of-view, that purchase is simply an <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> because he cannot avoid <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing it.<br/>
<br/>
But wait, there IS a way to avoid it.<br/>
<br/>
A <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er can escape <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> by becoming the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er of THAT <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion too.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er of a "pin factory" <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed the steel mines and smelters <small>(or whatever)</small> and all the equipment needed for THAT <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, then he would still have to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s <small>(including wages)</small>, but would no longer <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>s, since who would he possibly <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> them to?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> Perhaps that <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> is <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y owed to inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s</span><br/>
<br/>
Yes, this is a problem with WHO we choose as inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s were potential Consumers, and were investing for the purpose of *<a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t* instead of <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, then we could <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> them in <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t instead.<br/>
<br/>
For example, would you be willing to invest <small>(pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>)</small> $100 toward <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing shares in a Cell-Phone company <small>(<a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ed with say 999,999 other people)</small> that would then provide you with "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" service?<br/>
<br/>
Your <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er_<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e would be far lower since you would then be <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing only <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s while avoiding the 'leak' of <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to <a href="know.htm">know</a> how much more efficient this is, all we need to do is look at the 'earnings' of Sprint, Nextel, etc. to see what we would not be <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y needed to offset inflation</span><br/>
<br/>
We are so accustomed to the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a that inflation cannot be avoided.<br/>
<br/>
Who issues the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency for your nation?<br/>
<br/>
Is it your <small>(corrupt, and so there is another level of trouble)</small>government, or is it a cabal of private, offshore <a href="bank.htm">bank</a>ers?<br/>
<br/>
If you <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>e in the USA <small>(and nearly every other country on earth)</small>, that <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency is issued <small>(as disturbances on magentic media)</small> by private <a href="bank.htm">bank</a>ers who then buy US Bonds on the open market - bonds that, from what I understand, are largely <a href="back.htm">back</a>ed by the <a href="land.htm">land</a> of our national forests and other irreplacable assets.<br/>
<br/>
The National Debt is a direct result of this sham that is so filthy and <a href="back.htm">back</a>ward it can <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ly be believed or even comprehended why we <small>(the people)</small> would not just issue our <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency as some presidents <small>(Lincoln, Kennedy)</small> tried and were murderd because of.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="quot">> or to re-invest into expansion and development of the operation.</span><br/>
<br/>
Yes, this is a good point.&nbsp;&nbsp;I <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> should be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for growth, but my contention here is that the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership of those <a href="new.htm">new</a> investments should be <small>(or become as they 'vest')</small> the <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty of the person who *PAID* it - so that each <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er <small>(consumer)</small> slowly gains <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion according to the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> he is willing and able to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> above <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s until his <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er_<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e approaches and even can reach <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> If you think a $1 motor</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s $50 dollars because CEOs are <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing seven or eight figures,</span><br/>

<span class="quot">> think those unnecessary folks are leaching only a very small</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> percentage of the total <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y fluxing through the operation.</span><br/>
<br/>
CEOs are paid excessive wages <small>(which are booked as <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s)</small> because the pool of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers is not diversified enough to thwart such stupidity.<br/>
<br/>
The other <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers either do not have any <a href="real.htm">real</a> control <small>(blind inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s such as those buy Mutual <a href="fund.htm">Fund</a>s, etc.)</small>, or they are controlling <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers that do not complain because they also receive similar handouts.<br/>

<span class="quot">> I was hoping to explain not how to lower manufacturing <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s, but how</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> much more significant these <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s are than the mere <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e of scrap</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> metal.&nbsp;&nbsp;I brought up these <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s because I think these <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s are</span><br/>

<span class="quot">> with a burden of truly unnecessary <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s would quickly be put to rest</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> by another venture trying to eliminate those leaks.</span><br/>
<br/>
Perfect Competition would eliminate all <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, but Perfect Competition will occur only when every <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er has sufficient <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership in the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion needed to escape that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment.<br/>

<br/>
If so, then what is it they report as 'earnings' at the end of each quarter?<br/>

<span class="quot">> Andreas Wittel, in a post to the P2P Research list, asks</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> So why tinkering at the edges of a <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>tary system, why creating <a href="new.htm">new</a> ones? How could <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>tary systems stop or even diminish the exploitation of labour power? If they can't, why bother? Of course I am not suggesting that <a href="work.htm">work</a> towards a <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>tary system should be abandoned in the p2p community. I just don't see the point. I would like to focus my inquiries on the question how the p2p community can contribute to a fairer system of <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>tary exchange for labour <small>(= value)</small></span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> .</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> The answer is that ordinary <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers, by using <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>ed, crowd<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>ed, cooperative forms of social lending to aggregate their <a href="own.htm">own</a> small capitals into larger sums of investment capital, can finance <a href="work.htm">work</a>er-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ed enterprises through their <a href="own.htm">own</a> self-organized financial system - thus eliminating the monopoly <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>s previously paid to the <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e-privileged, <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e-licensed <a href="bank.htm">bank</a>ing <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>or for providing that service.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> .</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> We should keep in mind that the primary function of <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y isn't to serve as a <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>e of value. For the purposes of local <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omies, it is more important as a measure of value for facilitating exchange. Local <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>encies, LETS systems and other barter <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>s, provide liquidity to facilitate exchange of future <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts or services between ordinary <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers who may not have accumulated <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>es of past value. Local <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>encies enable <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers to directly exchange their wares within a <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>, without the interme<a href="diary.htm">diary</a> of conventional <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y from the outside capitalist <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> .</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> Thomas Hodgskin, writing in the 1830s, demolished the "labor <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>"defense of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> by pointing out that wages aren't paid by the capitalist out of accumulated past <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion. They are, rather, advanced from <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion by some <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers against future <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion by other <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers. The same function, of coordinating exchange of future <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts, could be carried out cooperatively by <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers themselves. By preempting the function and monopolizing it through a <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e-privileged <a href="bank.htm">bank</a>ing system, the capitalist or financier is able to collect tribute for it.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> .</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> If the <a href="real.htm">real</a>ization of capital follows a circuit, as described by Marx in Capital, the same is also true of labor. The circuit of labor is highly vulnerable to disruption. And the more steps in the circuit, the more likely it is to be broken, and the more likely the <a href="real.htm">real</a>ization of labor <small>(the transformation of labor into <a href="use.htm">use</a>-value, through the indirect means of exchanging one's <a href="own.htm">own</a> labor for wages, and exchanging those wages for <a href="use.htm">use</a>-value <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed by someone else's labor)</small> is to fail. When we <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipate in the capitalist <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy, we must first obtain <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y by either selling our services to a capitalist wage <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>er or amassing the <a href="start.htm">start</a>up capital for a high-overhead, high-risk conventional business to sell one's services to the customer. Then we take the <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y and <a href="use.htm">use</a> it to hire the services of others, with the a major <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e going to the overhead <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of a conventional capitalist enterprise, and the capitalist <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>er perhaps taking his cut as well. Local <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y systems, by promoting direct exchange between <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers, eliminate many of the insecurities and uncertainties of the capitalist <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy. By reducing the intermediate steps between <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and consumption, they also reduce the contingency involved in consumption.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> .</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> Michel Bauwens recently argued, contra Siefkes, that "there are important aspects of <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>tary transformation that are related to the peer to peer agenda."</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing to remember is that the peer to peer dynamic requires <a href="free.htm">free</a> or very easy access to means of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, and that this mostly <a href="work.htm">work</a>s for the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of non-rival immaterial goods, but that the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of physical goods, even if the designs can be open and <a href="free.htm">free</a>, need <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <a href="recover.htm">recover</a>y mechanisms....</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...For peer to peer self aggregation to occur, we need distributed infrastructures. Only if the individuals have control over their <a href="own.htm">own</a> means of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, can they <a href="free.htm">free</a>ly self-aggregate. That we can do peer <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of <a href="know.htm">know</a>ledge, software and designs is because <a href="know.htm">know</a>ledge <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers have access to <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ters and a socialized internet<a href="work.htm">work</a>. If we had distributed <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hinery, more distributed access to capital, more self-aggregation could occur.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...Peer to peer is about non-rival goods that can be re<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed at marginal <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> and abundantly.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more we can engineer abundance, the more this can happen. But classic capitalist <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y is about engineering scarcity, as are capitalist markets generally. <a href="mone.htm">Mone</a>tary transformation is aimed at creating sufficient <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y supplies, accessible by all.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> In Bauwens' recent debate with Michael Albert at Znet, Albert seemed preoccupied with the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a that peer <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion applies only in the immaterial <a href="real.htm">real</a>m, where the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s and permissions for obtaining inputs are negligible and the marginal <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of re<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is zero.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If some group <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>es outputs that require inputs, it would have to get the inputs. It would have to get the labor. People could say no. Permissions, and perhaps acquisitions, are involved. More, peer to peer seems to be only about undertaking joint ventures that have no significant <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s. Is that right?</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> But this misses the whole point, which we have seen above: that the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of inputs, even in physical <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, is not just a given but itself a dependent variable that can be affected by peer organization.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> Rather than there being an impermeable dividing line between qualitatively distinct categories of market and peer <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, it is more accurate to say that physical <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion can become more "peer-like," even when some aspects of it are governed by market exchange, as the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of physical <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion fall. The <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between cognitive and physical <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, and between <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="speech.htm">speech</a> and <a href="free.htm">free</a> beer, is one of degree rather than of kind.</span><br/>

<hr/><span class="date">Jun-08-2009:</span> Thoughts on careful word usage and role playing...<br/>
The terms 'consumer' and '<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>er' confuse our analysis by anthromorphosizing these <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic roles.<br/>
<br/>
Except for dependents, every actor is both a consumer AND a <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>er.<br/>
<br/>
Consumption and <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and are actions we take, not opposing groups that compete.<br/>
<br/>
There is no such thing as a <a href="work.htm">work</a>er that does not eat, nor are there eaters that do not <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
An actor may <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e a good which he does not consume.<br/>
An actor may consume a good which he did not <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
Most actors do both.&nbsp;&nbsp;They consume the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t of others while <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing for others.<br/>
<br/>
They also likely <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e some of what they consume, but that is not <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omically interesting.<br/>
<br/>
We each and all must complete both of these tasks.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership in the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion is not a question of "which group should have", but a question of "what actions should cause".<br/>
