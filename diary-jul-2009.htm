<hr/><span class="date">Jul-29-2009:</span> Why Words Fail<br/>
<br/>
Individuals and groups will downplay, deny and even despise negative feed<a href="back.htm">back</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Every negative message is interpreted as an attack that intends to disrupt or destroy.<br/>
<br/>
The receiver will not admit he is wrong, nor will he be taught, for both are considered 'losing'.<br/>
<br/>
The messenger becomes the enemy because it appears he wants the receiver to fail.<br/>
<br/>
This causes many potential messengers to avoid communication and the progress it might bring.<br/>
<br/>
Messengers that continue to try become more and more outcast until they are blocked completely.<br/>
<br/>
The messenger might instead communicate through physical action, but that is <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult alone.<br/>
<br/>
But organizing with others <small>(to communicate through physical action)</small> usually requires communication...<br/>

If you, along with a group of other concerned consumers, <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ed the Means of that <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion, then you would have ultimate <small>(above management level)</small> control of your portion of the output; and so, could direct the high-level goals without necessarily having the <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s needed to accomplish those goals.<br/>

Hello.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very excited about "Public <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership of Social Software?" because it intends to be "<a href="own.htm">own</a>ed and managed by <a href="user.htm">user</a>s".<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I think the <a href="title.htm">title</a> is confusing because of the potential for "<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership" to be interpreted as Copyright which might <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e this appear to be a bid to create a <a href="new.htm">new</a> license.<br/>
<br/>
I think a better name would <a href="use.htm">use</a> the word 'host' and maybe 'physical' or 'material' or '<a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e' or '<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age' to help convey our intent to help <a href="user.htm">user</a>s collectively buy, <a href="install.htm">install</a>, operate and maintain <small>(or <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> others to do so)</small> the physical infrastructure required to host "social software" <small>(or <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly any software and/or any media or data or any kind in my opinion)</small>.<br/>

I've been wishing the city I <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>e in would choose nut trees, fruit trees, berry bushes, grape vines for the otherwise ornamental plants they <a href="install.htm">install</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;We <small>(the people of that city)</small> could also choose spices and herbs for the smaller ornamentals; and many other plants such as squash, peppers, even tomato and potato look as pretty as many of the barren greenery we suicidally choose instead.<br/>
<br/>
By doing so, as oil increases in <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e, and as un<a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ment increases in severity, and as the Federal Reserve <a href="note.htm">Note</a> continues to lose value, we will then have plenty of <a href="work.htm">work</a> to do with enormous direct reward.<br/>
<br/>
But this is all assuming we would be growing for our *<a href="own.htm">own</a>* consumption instead of attempting to sell any of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
Since we don't have any <a href="real.htm">real</a> control at the city level I wonder if you see a neighborhood/community doing this - moving toward permaculture - do you see that as a negative thing?<br/>
<br/>
Must we continue to water and <a href="work.htm">work</a> on plants that have no value whatsoever while hoping we can afford to purchase Pine Nuts from China?&nbsp;&nbsp;Wouldn't you rather <a href="know.htm">know</a> what was <a href="spray.htm">spray</a>ed on them and wouldn't you rather have the security that those trees will <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e each year, dropping the food nearly at our doorstep without the need for petroleum or the increasing political <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>iculty of crossing borders?<br/>
Do we <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly want to be in the stranglehold of another nation?<br/>
<br/>
And even if the food is <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed in the country you <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>e in, if it is <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by a for-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> corporation, then they will <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e it too expensive to even consider.<br/>
<br/>
We could have hundreds of tons of nearly <a href="free.htm">free</a> food and the raw materials for medicines, <a href="soap.htm">soap</a>s, clothes and <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>ding materials if we would get-over our myopic mindset that governments should never be <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive.<br/>
<br/>
Local <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult for single individual, but is a powerful solution when we can "get together" to share the complexity.<br/>
<br/>
We <small>(the people)</small> should be <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing sawmills, plastic-recycling equipment, repair shops, restaurants <small>(yes, restaurants)</small>, <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age facilities, agriculture equipment and factories of all sorts.<br/>
<br/>
But we are too scared or too stupid ... but another problem that leads to such pitifully weak cities is the way <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty taxes punish improvements while allowing <a href="land.htm">land</a>-hoarders to withhold as much as they want - leading to sprawl and destitution.<br/>
<br/>
There is more to this, but I must "go to <a href="work.htm">work</a>" to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> a mortgage <small>(literally "death grip")</small> to <a href="bank.htm">bank</a>ers that never did any <a href="work.htm">work</a> in their <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>es and yet steal almost all of our value because we fail to organize locally for our good.&nbsp;&nbsp;We, the potential consumers, must organize for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t instead of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>

<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion should not be about "exchange value", it should be about "<a href="use.htm">use</a> value".<br/>

<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is not a measure of success, it is a measure of failure!<br/>

We must stop playing this hideous and immoral <a href="game.htm">game</a> of keeping <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>, for it causes those who are rewarded to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e choices that further increase scarcity - including biodiversity destruction through the elimination of entire species.<br/>
<br/>

Yes, as you say, if the *consumer* is the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er, this is true <small>(or can be true for experienced gardeners)</small> even for a single-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er plot, and almost always will be true for a multi-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er <small>(<a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by multiple consumers)</small> plot since their <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e for the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t will then be exactly <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> without the needless drain of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>

<br/>
The concept of "cash crops" is as vile and destructive as any and all "for <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>" business since the only purpose of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is to keep <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <small>(to collect <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> from the consumer)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is, unfortunately, also the case for all "<a href="work.htm">work</a>er <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed" business.<br/>

Stefan,<br/>
By "exchange based system" are you talking about *any* form of <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e, or are you talking about the "for-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>" subset that attempts to maximize "exchange value"?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Kevin,<br/>
If by "exchange-based system" you are referring to "for <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>" <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e, then you are incorrect in claiming it does not require scarcity, since <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> <small>(<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>)</small> is the very measure of scarcity with regards to the consumer who <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Without scarcity, <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e hits <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> and <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s hit zero, while wages are unaffected <small>(wages are a <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, a "for <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>" business would never attempt to 'solve' scarcity, for to do so will reduce and finally destroy <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
"For <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>" businesses are on a desperately problematic and <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly even suicidally dangerous road requiring <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity and purposeful destruction to keep their consumers dependent.<br/>
<br/>
A <a class="ext" href="http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_feedback">http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_feedback</a> loop that will 'solve' scarcity is treating <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as a <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er's investment - so that <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion is continuously balanced across all those willing to spend more than <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> for the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts they need.<br/>
<br/>
When I say 'spend' I don't mean any sort of '<a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y' is necessarily required.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm talking about <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ing the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er, but from the *consuming* side, for every <a href="work.htm">work</a>er is also a consumer.<br/>

Treating <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as a consumer's investment is the only <a class="ext" href="http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_stabiliser">http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_stabiliser</a> needed to solve scarcity.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp;* What do you think it should be doing?</span><br/>

There is no reason to treat data separately from code.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it be Genetic-info <small>(DNA)</small>, Music, Video, software, <a href="cad.htm">CAD</a>-<a href="file.htm">file</a>s, indigenous <a href="know.htm">know</a>ledge, techniques and information about how to accomplish any thing, etc. it is all the 'design' <a href="part.htm">part</a> of nature.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> tries to "lock-open" copyrightable design.&nbsp;&nbsp;This <a href="work.htm">work</a>s for code or data - it is the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;The '<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e' of a movie is the original, uncompressed data that is needed to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e *quality* changes to that design.<br/>
<br/>
But the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> does not, and cannot go far enough because it is only addressing the 'design' half of <a href="real.htm">real</a>ity.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="agpl.htm">AGPL</a> tries to poke the material sphere by legislating <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e be delivered even when a design is being 'expressed' on re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es the <a href="user.htm">user</a> does not <a href="own.htm">own</a> and then being made available in a '<a href="remot.htm">remot</a>e' fashion to that <a href="user.htm">user</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp;* What impact should it be having?</span><br/>
<br/>
The most potent direction we could travel <small>(and this is the same message I have for the FSF)</small> is to <a href="real.htm">real</a>ize "<a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom" can and must be <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ed for the 'material' or 'physical' components that are required to "host" any and all designs.<br/>
<br/>
Licensing that "locks-open" a design is good and needed, but it can only go so far because all design requires <a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e, mass and energy for <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age and 'expression'.<br/>
<br/>
The next step is to devise a "Terms of Operation" or a legally binding Contract that groups of <a href="user.htm">user</a>s can choose to apply to some "Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es" they will then <a href="use.htm">use</a> to "host" things such as e<a href="mail.htm">mail</a>, video, audio, home-pages, wikis, etc. ... and even the far more important goals of housing, plants and animals for food and medicine <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, factories, mines, ... ANY and ALL material Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
We can and must learn how to share Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es and begin ignoring the for-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> corporations that want to withhold our <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom through <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity and purposeful destruction of our otherwise natural inheritance.<br/>

My plan is to <a href="start.htm">start</a> something that sounds <small>(in my mind)</small> similar to what you <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ose - I think of it as a "community center", but we could <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e it appear as an internet cafe or some sort of <a href="work.htm">work</a>shop or maybe a <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>al agency.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the <a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e and most of the tools would be available for <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> or purchase.&nbsp;&nbsp;Customers could <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age areas as small as a <a href="mail.htm">mail</a>box or rooms to sleep or to relax in other ways <small>(watch movies, play <a href="game.htm">game</a>s, etc.)</small>; <a href="work.htm">work</a> areas for wood<a href="work.htm">work</a>ing, steel<a href="work.htm">work</a>ing, car repair, sewing <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hines, larger clothes-washing <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hines, etc. and of course <small>(and <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly most importantly)</small> we want to be <a href="install.htm">install</a>ing and maintaining permaculture <a href="land.htm">land</a>scaping to regain control of of our food, medicine, <a href="soap.htm">soap</a>, clothing and <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>ding materials.<br/>
<br/>
I don't want to get "too carried away" at first so as to avoid capsizing the operation, but just wanted let you <a href="know.htm">know</a> my longer-term vision includes any and all forms of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
I think we could <a href="start.htm">start</a> as simply as <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ing a commercial <a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e in some city and incorporating under a "Terms of Operation" that enforce the treatment of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as I have described.<br/>
<br/>
It seems likely we might also be able to achieve "non-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>" <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>us, especially if we become a religion - though that may be too confusing or become a burden in other unforseen ways...<br/>

<hr/><span class="date">Jul-02-2009:</span> <a class="ext" href="http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand">Wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand</a> <span class="quot2">>>Supply and demand is an <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el based on <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e, utility and quantity in a market. It concludes that in a competitive market, <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e will function to equalize the quantity demanded by consumers, and the quantity supplied by <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers, resulting in an <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic equilibrium of <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e and quantity. An increase in the quantity <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed or supplied will typically result in a reduction in <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e and vice-versa. Similarly, an increase in the number of <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers tends to result in lower wages and vice-versa. The <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el incorporates other factors changing equilibrium as a shift of demand and/or supply.</span><br/>
