<hr/><span class="date">Feb-25-2011:</span> Unions for Immaterial <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion?<br/>
The effectiveness of collective bargaining has always been threatened by independent peers who are willing to accept lower wages and endure poor <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing conditions.<br/>
<br/>
For <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional manufacturing <a href="job.htm">job</a>s, these 'alternate' <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers can usually be kept from accessing the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion by forming a physical barrier around the <a href="work.htm">work</a>site or through various threats that can be carried out because it is easy to <a href="moni.htm">moni</a>tor who is actually entering the establishment.<br/>
<br/>
Yet these valuable techniques of intimidation and coercion so vital to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ing <a href="work.htm">Work</a>er Rights are unlikely to be applicable in the <a href="real.htm">real</a>m of "immaterial <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion".<br/>
<br/>
When it comes to something like <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software, how can we, the International Programmers of the World, unionize effectively to *stop* independent programmers from creating the solutions that consumers need?<br/>
<br/>
This is a catastrophic issue, as many of these independents are willing to <a href="work.htm">work</a> not just for a low Wage, but for <a href="free.htm">Free</a>!&nbsp;&nbsp;They often fix bugs and add features without any <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> at all!<br/>
<br/>
How can <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers in the 'immaterial' sphere possibly "<a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e a <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>ing" with such anarchy and disrespect for organized labor, and with no ability to stop that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion?<br/>

<span class="quot">> Has that <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y always been on earth? If not, then where did it come from? Did somebody issue it into existence? If so, then by what authority did they do so, and for what reason do nations lack that authority?</span><br/>

<hr/><span class="date">Feb-21-2011:</span> <a class="ext" href="http://Quora.com/What-are-the-criticisms-of-the-Federal-Reserve-Should-it-exist">Quora.com/What-are-the-criticisms-of-the-Federal-Reserve-Should-it-exist</a><br/>
<span class="quot">> What are the criticisms of the Federal Reserve? Should it exist?</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> Why do people write books like this? <a class="ext" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/2490203/The-Federal-Reserve-Monster-1922">http://www.scribd.com/doc/2490203/The-Federal-Reserve-Monster-1922</a></span><br/>
<br/>
The primary problem with the system which includes the Federal Reserve is that we suffer the terrible consequences of a National Debt that would be exactly zero if we, as a nation, would simply issue our <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency instead of borrowing <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y from outside entities.<br/>
<br/>
You may think "Well, of course we must borrow it - how else can you get <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y!?".<br/>
<br/>
But that reasoning is obviously flawed when we ask the question "Where did that <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y come from?".<br/>
<br/>
Either the <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y has always been on earth, or it has been 'issued' into existence.<br/>
<br/>
So the <a href="bank.htm">bank</a>s behind the Federal Reserve who issue <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency into existence "out of thin air" <small>(it is fiat <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y with is not <a href="back.htm">back</a>ed by any material thing)</small> are able to buy bonds against our <a href="land.htm">land</a> while expending no value and taking no risk whatever.<br/>
<br/>
So we are accumulating debt and losing our sovereignty for no sensible reason.<br/>
<br/>
If those <a href="bank.htm">bank</a>s are able to issue <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency, then why will our government not issue <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency?<br/>
<br/>
Our nation has issued it's <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency in the past, and had no National Debt, but the <a href="bank.htm">bank</a>ers tricked us into subservience by playing on our fears, and so now we are at the mercy of those who conquer nations through trickery and deception.<br/>
<br/>
After we default on those needless loans, they will arrive on our shores declaring we must leave, as they are now the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of this <a href="land.htm">land</a> because of the bonds they hold against it.<br/>

<span class="quot">> What would be the optimal approach for globally <a href="real.htm">real</a>igning the incentives of <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omies from maximizing <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s to maximizing value?</span><br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is commonly <a href="use.htm">use</a>d as a return for inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s who took risk.<br/>
<br/>
It may seem there is nothing else we can do, for what else would inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s accept?<br/>
<br/>
There is a special case we seemed to have overlooked, where we can <a href="use.htm">use</a> <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t to reward those who are willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> early.<br/>
<br/>
This special case only applies to inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s who are simultaneously potential consumers of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t - and who invest only as much as it will take to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e what they, personally, will consume.<br/>
<br/>
So the answer is similar to "Crowd <a href="fund.htm">Fund</a>ed", but more like "Consumer <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ed" - where those <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ers are <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers in the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion for the sole purpose of thereby having <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the outputs of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion as a sort of "side effect".<br/>
<br/>
Notice the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is not sold <small>(for it is already the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of those who will <a href="use.htm">use</a> it)</small>. This causes <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> to be undefined - for the <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e of the finished <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is exactly the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s which were paid for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>

Hey Dante,<br/>
<br/>
I would like talk more about this when you have some time.<br/>
<br/>
Could you give me an example of what you mean?<br/>
<br/>
Here are some concepts to frame the discussion:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I've been trying lately to devise the most simple scenario,<br/>
for <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership and have come up with the following:<br/>
<br/>
<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine some agents are attempting to share the physical<br/>
<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es required for <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age.<br/>
<br/>
Whether they are attempting to <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>e bytes or bread doesn't<br/>
<a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e much <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence, in both cases the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t being<br/>
<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>ed is subject to decay and destruction.<br/>
<br/>
One question I have is: Who, <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>ally, should be in control<br/>
of those physical assets?&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>(I would say "who should <a href="own.htm">own</a>",<br/>
but if I remember right, you are reluctant to <a href="use.htm">use</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in our quest to secure the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion?)</small><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another question comes as a result of accepting outsiders.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine they want to increase the size of the operation<br/>
for even more benefits associated with <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy of scale.<br/>
<br/>
Should they charge <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> <small>(<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>)</small> against those<br/>
latecomers?&nbsp;&nbsp;And if so, what should be done with that<br/>
value?&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice, if you do not charge <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, then it is likely<br/>
someone will 'scalp' the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t by buying a large a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a><br/>
and then reselling it closer to what the "market will bear".<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Hi Dante,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for helping me understand you better.<br/>
<br/>
I see now you are designing a tool which<br/>
you and others can <a href="use.htm">use</a> to discover *which*<br/>
set of system dynamics are best for society,<br/>
<br/>
while I have been trying to design and debug<br/>
one specific set of dynamics which groups<br/>
can then <a href="use.htm">use</a> to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e better societies.<br/>
<br/>
I have found my approach is a bit too direct<br/>
for most people because they interpret my<br/>
<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>osals as though I am declaring what<br/>
they must or must not do, even though my<br/>
intent is for those readers to help change<br/>
what is wrong and clarify what is right...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now I will try to understand you even more<br/>
clearly by asking questions according to<br/>
what I perceive as your intent in each case:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Do you mean so we can <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s,<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> Actually, in the approach I <a href="imag.htm">imag</a>ine,</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> any kind of transaction contract can be</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> described / suggested, queried,</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> then <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>d upon.</span><br/>
<br/>
I like this <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a if it will help us <a href="work.htm">work</a> toward<br/>
improving a 'best' Transaction Contract<br/>
which can then be suggested to all <a href="new.htm">new</a>comers,<br/>
a bit like the way the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> is the<br/>
defacto standard for most <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is important so we can gain<br/>
the sufficient momentum needed to overcome<br/>
Capitalism - to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e that system obsolete.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> my principal concern is to reduce</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> the opportunities for centralized control,</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> hence any approach that goes towards</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> further distributing control suits me best.</span><br/>
<br/>
Absolutely.<br/>
<br/>
We want to "dis-tribute" control -<br/>
so&nbsp;&nbsp;we can finally stop <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing<br/>
tribute <small>(<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> to others.<br/>
<br/>
Paradoxically, that is why I claim<br/>
we must, as groups, collect <a href="profit.htm">profit</a><br/>
from those who do not yet have<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership so we can treat it in<br/>
the 'correct' manner - for if WE<br/>
do not collect <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>, OTHERS<br/>
certainly will, and at that point<br/>
the decision about how to treat<br/>
that special value will be out of<br/>
our jurisdiction.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> I do not mind a "shares" approach,</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> especially if it are shares <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> by the people that <a href="use.htm">use</a> it.</span><br/>
<br/>
Yes, of course.&nbsp;&nbsp;By *all* the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s,<br/>
even if they arrive late.<br/>
<br/>
We must worry about "late coming"<br/>
<a href="user.htm">user</a>s who do not yet have <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership<br/>
because they are dependent upon<br/>
the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers in such a way<br/>
that allows those <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers to charge<br/>
a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above the <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion - coercing those late-<br/>
comers to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
If that overpayment is treated<br/>
as that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er's investment, the<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er increases<br/>
incrementally - so that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a><br/>
within the whole system will<br/>
naturally, continuously and safely<br/>
approach zero as it should.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> The intention to reduce then eradicate monopolies,</span><br/>
<br/>
Yes, yes, let's dis-tribute all<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership by helping everyone<br/>
invest - even latecomers who<br/>
will be investing for their <a href="own.htm">own</a><br/>
good when they <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> I could <a href="imag.htm">imag</a>ine such conditions could be defined</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> in the "license" of the shares ?</span><br/>
<br/>
Yes, I think of this as a<br/>
Terms of Operation, which<br/>
I think is quite common for<br/>
organizations of all types<br/>
to have drawn up for the<br/>
purpose understanding the<br/>
goals and restrictions within<br/>
that domain...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> For example, only enable purchase of shares</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> equivalent to the potential usage of a person,</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> and in case it is not for personal usage</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> <small>( in the case of an investment )</small>, define</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> specific conditions which do not <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e it speculative.</span><br/>
<br/>
I <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>, and have some very<br/>
specific approaches to trying<br/>
to achieve those goals, but<br/>
won't go into that now for fear<br/>

<span class="quot">> I am also in touch with Bernard Lietaer, here in Belgium, who could,</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> based on a plan,</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> facilitate such process through the recognition he has in certain</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> <a href="back.htm">back</a>grounds.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> There is a possibility for <a href="part.htm">part</a>nerships.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> Define precise goals, converging friends,</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> and eventually get institutional support,</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> is what I would like to move towards.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> How to <a href="start.htm">start</a> communicating such approach ?</span><br/>
<br/>
I hope we can find a way.<br/>
