Marcin,<br/>
<br/>
Are you saying that we cannot organize to <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> a large factory or farm?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">"'What are you doing to organize the means of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion to a smaller organizational scale of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers? ... I <a href="know.htm">know</a> my answer. Fab labs. Open repository of digital design.'"</span><br/>
<br/>
I think the reason for the excessive interest in magical fabbers and "desktop manufacturing" is an attempt at avoiding the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult issue of <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
People want the advantage of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion so they can have control, but want to avoid the sticky issue of <a href="part.htm">part</a>ial <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
Individual <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of Personal <a href="compu.htm">Compu</a>ters <small>(PCs)</small> is a big <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the success in the P2P paradigm and of <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software and 'online' <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;These Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es are cheap enough that many people can afford one in their <a href="own.htm">own</a> home and ISP charges are just quietly disregarded.<br/>
<br/>
Collective <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es is <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult, but obviously is "worth it" for many kinds of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion - for that is the role that Capitalist corporations <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently fill.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, a person could choose to individually <a href="own.htm">own</a> a milk cow so they could get "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" milk, but they couldn't afford the better tools like a fancy milking <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine, so would likely have to the <a href="work.htm">work</a> themselves since hiring someone to come for that little bit of time would <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ly be worth it unless you overpaid them.&nbsp;&nbsp;And it probably wouldn't be worth it to grow their <a href="own.htm">own</a> alfalfa, or to purchase expensive medical/vet tools, so would be <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing "<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" to feed and provide medical care for the animal, and so on, recursively for the entire chain <small>(actually tree)</small> of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is great savings in eventually <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es for every step required for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, and that is one of the savings in the "efficiency of scale".<br/>
<br/>
Most people do not INDIVIDUALLY <a href="own.htm">own</a> a milk cow even though there are great advantages of controlling exactly what the cow is fed and whether or not it is injected with <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial hor<a href="mone.htm">mone</a>s, and is treated humanely, etc. because it is just not <a href="real.htm">real</a>istic to INDIVIDUALLY <a href="own.htm">own</a> - it is too much trouble.<br/>
<br/>
But it WOULD be "worth it" for 10 or 100 or 1000 neighbors to COLLECTIVELY <a href="own.htm">own</a> a small dairy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each consumer would have as much vote control as they have percentage of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, and when the majority wanted to do something that caused a division, the minority should be able to 'fork' from the rest of the group to avoid the excessive granularity of typical 'democracy'.<br/>
<br/>
So the problem I am <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing on is in describing how to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e collective <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership self perpetuating.<br/>
<br/>
The primary secret I have discovered that has been purposefully hidden or accidentally lost is that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> <small>(<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>)</small> is a measure of a consumer's dependence on the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, and is 'balanced' by treating that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment as an investment from the consumer that paid it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<hr/><span class="date">Feb-26-2008:</span> E<a href="mail.htm">mail</a> reply to Marcin<br/>
<span class="quot">> Ok, I think i <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> with the logic. But what is the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive capacity of</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> these Organizations that will help people see the value of joining? Is there</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> something like a value portfolio that is displayed? Is the value <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>tary or</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> in-kind <small>(<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts and services)</small>?</span><br/>
<br/>
Just for clarity I will reiterate that treating <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as an investment from the consumer who paid it automates the incremental growth of the organization, but that comes AFTER we overcome the initial investments required to begin.<br/>
<br/>
So the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>iculty is in the intial <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing.<br/>
<br/>
Since the originating inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s can never expect to collect <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> for themselves, the motivation must come from somewhere else.<br/>
<br/>
1. At-<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t<small>(*)</small>: A paritial <a href="own.htm">own</a>er <small>(controlling shareholder)</small> will receive as much of the outputs of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion as he has percentage of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you <a href="own.htm">own</a> 15% of an apple tree, and enough of the "supporting <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es" required to deal with your percentage of that tree <small>{such as the <a href="land.htm">land</a>, water rights, tractor, tools, etc.}</small>, then you will automatically <a href="own.htm">own</a> 15% of the harvest of that tree at the end of that round of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice you will still need to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s - including any wages, but <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is not even possible unless you were to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> it to yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is undefined in this case.<br/>
<br/>
1a. You may choose to sell or give away any or all of your apples, but your association with the other <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers under the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>aw means those <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects are also under that contract.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2. Consumer Control: By investing early, you have immediat vote-weight over that establishment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's say you <small>(an investing consumer)</small> want a restaurant that serves good food at a reasonable <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e and <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s it's <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers well.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we are <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing all <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s <small>(including wages)</small> + <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>, we can easily <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s alone while increasing wages since <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> will only be paid by those that do not yet have sufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
3. <a href="work.htm">Work</a> Sharing: Creating such establishments allows us to finally maximize the <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e of labor.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can then go "out to eat" for every meal because it will never be more expensive than cooking a meal at home.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure you must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers, but your time is valuable too right?&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence from a Capitalist restaurant is that you no longer <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a><small>(*)</small>, so we no longer need to avoid the value that specialization brings.<br/>
<br/>
<small>(*)</small> <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects are usually perfectly "At-<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>" only for brief periods of time because consumers are dynamic in many <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> ways, so a change in a consumer's desire <small>(say from apples to pears)</small> will not be available "At-<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>" until the "<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e Above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>" <small>(<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> that they <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for the <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t has been invested for them, and those <a href="new.htm">new</a> Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es have become <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive for them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> I <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> that people will want to join,</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> because they get great value in return - and the point is to explain to</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> people clearly how they will benefit. What are your comments on that?</span><br/>
<br/>
<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine you need some <a href="work.htm">work</a> done on your house or your car.<br/>
<br/>
1. If you are lucky enough to have the needed <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s, you might try to buy cheap versions of some of the tools you will need, but must avoid the more expensive things because it will not be "worth it" for the small a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> you will utilize them.<br/>
<br/>
2. You can contact a typical Capitalist business with non-<a href="work.htm">work</a>ing <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers and non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ing <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers who will have both <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s and the better tools, but you must then <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <small>(<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> without ever earning <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in that organization.<br/>
<br/>
3. You can contact a smaller Capitalist business where all the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers are <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers and all the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers are <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.&nbsp;&nbsp;They will also have <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s and better tools, but will <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> themselves much more than the non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ing <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers in <small>(2.)</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> you usually paid now appears to be wage, but it is actually hidden <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as proved by the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers disallowing other non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ing <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers to bid to access the tools.&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, competition between all possible <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers is not maximized.&nbsp;&nbsp;The non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ing <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers described in <small>(2.)</small> would not be allowed to <a href="work.htm">work</a> with these tools at the wage they <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>d upon before.<br/>
<br/>
4. You could get together with 100 neighbors and buy the expensive tools that you will a percentage of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can then hire non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ing <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers at a wage above <small>(2.)</small> while still <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing less than either <small>(2. or 3.)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can also choose to do the <a href="work.htm">work</a> yourself if you have those <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s, and can do all variety of things that other corporations arbitrarily don't allow.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>
I'm happy that this stuff is finally getting some attention, but I want to be very clear that I seek no glory for myself.<br/>
<br/>
The things that I am talking about could not have been 'invented' by anybody, they are simply truths that were waiting to be discovered - maybe like gravity.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Ric<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> <a href="stallman.htm">Stallman</a> that discovered the <a href="user.htm">User</a>s must gain Control.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are helping to generalize that discovery.<br/>

I was thinking about your concern that we would need to track all <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects <small>(<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts)</small> that are purchased as <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>ed and then resold as not.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the problem is small for these reasons:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span> The trouble you point out only occurs when an <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect is illegally <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ed <small>(breaking contract law)</small> by removing the notice that the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect is under that contract, and even then the damage is isolated to the <a href="new.htm">new</a> consumer in that the <a href="new.htm">new</a> consumer is simply unaware of their rights becuase the information is hidden from them.&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly help the middle-man seller.<br/>

Well, I targeted OLPC mainly because I thought their minds might be open to such an <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the strategy I have in mind to solve our <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic woes applies equally well to any industry.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote a paper with a <a href="title.htm">title</a> that spoofs the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a of giving laptops to the poor when so many don't even have food/cloth/shelter/<a href="soap.htm">soap</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the paper is "One Loaf Per Child" which you can read at <a class="ext" href="http://Blog.P2PFoundation.net/one-loaf-per-child/2007/06/14">http://Blog.P2PFoundation.net/one-loaf-per-child/2007/06/14</a><br/>

If the consumers were the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of the farms, factories and <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>s, we would have the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts of those physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es AT <a href="cost.htm">COST</a>, and could arbitrarily add all the features we want AT <a href="cost.htm">COST</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;When consumer is <a href="own.htm">own</a>er, <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> has no meaning except maybe as an investment in more <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es for future <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, if you <a href="own.htm">own</a> an apple tree, you may <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> someone to tend and harvest the apples, but you cannot <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> unless you were to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> it to yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp;When an <a href="own.htm">own</a>er is the consumer, <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e and <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> are the same thing!<br/>
<br/>
Why <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> so much for a text message?&nbsp;&nbsp;Why <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> so much just to transmit a bit of data <small>(access the internet)</small>?&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly <a href="cost.htm">COST</a> these <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>rietary cell-phone 'service' companies $40/month?&nbsp;&nbsp;That question is easy to answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just look at the numbers they call '<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>'.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is explicitly and plainly "<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>".<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> and Wage are somewhat 'mixed' when <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers are the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers because the division is arbitrary.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="work.htm">Work</a>er/<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers may overpay themselves and the consumers can do nothing about it, but when the Consumers are the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers, Wage is a clearly defined <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> because competition is then between all qualified <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers instead of between the few that happen to also be <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers in that corporation.<br/>
<br/>
When Consumers are <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers <small>(when an organization is "<a href="user own.htm">User Own</a>ed")</small>, <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> tends toward zero and <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e tends toward <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;I say "tends toward" instead of "is" because Consumers are dynamic in many ways - they are born, they die, they "move in", the "move out", they want something this year, and not the next, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, since they will rarely have 'perfect' <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts they need, they will usually be <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing "<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" as an investment toward perfect <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es so <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e approaches <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> and <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> approaches zero.<br/>

IF a copyright holder CHOOSES to defend their <a href="work.htm">work</a>, the <a href="gplv3.htm">GPLv3</a> and <a href="agpl.htm">AGPL</a> are a stronger defense.&nbsp;&nbsp;This has nothing to do with people that are not CHOOSING to release code.<br/>

<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> requires dependence.&nbsp;&nbsp;The consumer must be dependent upon the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wage has no such requirement.<br/>

<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is not needed by a society, it shows how far we are from having the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion fully distributed.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is easily solved by treating all <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> as an investment from the consumer that paid it.<br/>
<br/>

I hear you.<br/>
<br/>
I worry we are running out of time.<br/>
<br/>
We need to buy <a href="land.htm">land</a> and bees and fruit/nut bushes/trees NOW, before it is obvious that we must.<br/>
<br/>
If we wait until it is clear to the general <a href="pop.htm">pop</a>ulation, it will probably be too late and we will have no alternative than to beg our federal government to house and <a href="employ.htm">employ</a> us in the facilities they have already constructed for that purpose...<br/>
<br/>
I am on-board with your goals; it only sounds like I'm not because I'm attempting to address the <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>amental issue of re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e misallocation that got us here in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, if we <a href="start.htm">start</a> a <a href="new.htm">new</a> 'group', how will we <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e it doesn't turn sour in the same way our <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent 'society' has?&nbsp;&nbsp;Why has nobody ever been able to organize in such a way that they are able to overgrow the situation we see now?<br/>
<br/>
Is Capitalism optimally efficient?&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't see how anyone could claim that, but if it is not, then why does that '<a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el' always tend to 'win' as any <a href="new.htm">new</a> group tries to scale?<br/>
<br/>
Why, as the size of a well-meaning group grows, does Capitalism almost inevitably rear it's head within that group and destroy the original goals of abundance and peace?<br/>

<hr/><span class="date">Feb-18-2008:</span> Marcin Jakubowski called me on my warbly cell phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;We spoke for about an hour about his <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion Commons.<br/>

<hr/><span class="date">Feb-18-2008:</span> E<a href="mail.htm">mail</a> to Marcin Jakubowski<br/>
<span class="quot">> It is essentially an organized</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> effort for open engineering and <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t R&amp;D for the public interest, and it</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> is applicable to any <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t within the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent industrial system.</span><br/>
<br/>
The words 'engineering' and 'industrial' without mention of "naturally <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive" <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es me think something as simple as an <small>(non-GMO)</small> apple tree or a chicken will not be handled <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ly <small>(from capitalism)</small> within a <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion Commons.&nbsp;&nbsp;If that is true, then the sentence is fine, otherwise you might want to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e it more inlusive.<br/>
<br/>
On a similar <a href="note.htm">note</a>, will industrial capital that a <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion Commons cannot yet create <small>(such as the drill-press I saw Brittany operating)</small> be under the 'rule' of the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion Commons, or is that not within the scope of this project?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> 1. People volunteer time and re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es to develop <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts</span><br/>
<br/>
By 'develop' do you mostly mean the 'design' of <a href="new.htm">new</a> industrial <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hines, or are you including the 'development' of something as mundane and ancient as another instance of an apple tree which may require unglamorous ditch digging?&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you morally or strictly opposed to the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment of wages or other compensation for the <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ing of specialized labor?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> 2. <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion facilities are <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>t and donated into the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion commons</span><br/>
<br/>
Does the word 'facilities' include both <a href="land.htm">land</a> <small>(surface area)</small> and capital <small>(such as a tractor)</small>?<br/>
<br/>
Are you interested in discussing how to <a href="recover.htm">recover</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s and/or the scheduling required for sharing those physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es among many people?<br/>
<br/>
Should we save such details for a later discussion, or do you view them as fully unimportant - that we will just "get along" without a need to outline such nit-<a href="pic.htm">pic</a>king?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> 3. A <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is made available at the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion</span><br/>
<br/>
I understand this stance, and have thought the same thing in the past, but think it is slightly wrong now that I understand <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> to be a plea for growth from the consumer who <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s it.<br/>
<br/>
I <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> that we should <a href="work.htm">work</a> *toward* <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t available "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>", but I think it should be a final *result* of our actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;We should approach that goal somewhat indirectly by treating all "<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" <small>(<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> as an INVESTMENT from the consumer that paid it.<br/>
<br/>
By charging whatever the "market will bear", we will also have a steady supply of <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing from people <small>(consumers)</small> who want <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, but do not expect to receive <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Again, to summarize, instead of holding the consumer_<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e down at <a href="own.htm">own</a>er_<a href="cost.htm">cost</a>, I think it best to charge whatever the consumer is willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>, and then treat that overpayment as an investment from that very same consumer.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm still not sure how or when the control of that investment should 'vest' to that consumer, but as consumers gain <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e naturally tends toward <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <small>(and <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> toward zero)</small> since the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of an apple tree who is also the consumer of those apples cannot <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> - it becomes essentially undefined <small>[unless he were to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> it to himself toward future <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion - again, as his <a href="own.htm">own</a> investment toward future <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion...]</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> We are simply eliminating the development, intellectual <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty,</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> capitalization, overhead, competitive waste, and other <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s- to create a</span><br/>
<br/>
I think I understand what you mean by "competitive waste" but you may need to be more clear because I also think maximizing competition between <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers is actually a good thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will try to write more about how and why this is the case.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> novel way to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e physical goods. This is <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>ntical to the open <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e</span><br/>

<span class="quot">> physical <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion into the mix.</span><br/>
<br/>
<a href="ide.htm">Ide</a>ntical?&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you mean by "sharing development <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s"?<br/>
<br/>
One of the big problems with <a href="free.htm">Free</a> <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e software is how the consumers have not found a good way to connect with the <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>ed <a href="work.htm">work</a>er to incent him to <a href="work.htm">work</a> on things he isn't just incidentally interested in.<br/>

When you say 'open' are you talking about opening the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion?<br/>
<br/>
If you are opening the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, do you have plans to <a href="recover.htm">recover</a> the <a href="real.htm">real</a> and re<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ing <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of those physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, including wages?<br/>
<br/>
If you are planning to <a href="recover.htm">recover</a> those <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s, do plan to also collect the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> that <a href="user.htm">user</a>s will <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <small>(<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> depending upon what the market will bear?<br/>
<br/>
If you collect <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> will it be distributed to the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers and/or <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers of your business as is almost universally the case?<br/>
<br/>
Why do <a href="user.htm">user</a>s <small>(consumers)</small> <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>?&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember, wages are a <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>, and consumers <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s - but why or how are they "tricked into" <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing MORE than <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>?&nbsp;&nbsp;What does <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> even mean?&nbsp;&nbsp;Isn't <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> a measure of the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>iculty that <a href="user.htm">user</a> would have in purchasing and organizing the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion?&nbsp;&nbsp;Isn't <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> a plea for growth from the consumer that paid it?<br/>
<br/>
If a <a href="user.htm">user</a> had sufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, he would still have to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s, including the wage of those <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>ed enough to <a href="install.htm">install</a>, maintain and operate those physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, but he wouldn't have to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> more than that - he could get the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" because to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> would be meaningless unless he were to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> it to himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is 'undefined' when the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s are <a href="free.htm">free</a> to control the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
If you read what Saint IGNUcius <small>(Ric<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> <a href="stallman.htm">Stallman</a>)</small> writes about <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom you will see it is "<a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom".&nbsp;&nbsp;He says "<a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom for evey <a href="user.htm">user</a>".<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> is a copyright license that only covers intangible, immaterial, '<a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual' <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you <small>(or we)</small> intend to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e a business that is 'Open', it seems prudent to observe that '<a href="free.htm">Free</a>' as in <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom means it must be the <a href="user.htm">USER</a>S that gain control of the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, even <small>(and most importantly)</small> when they do not happen to have the <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s to operate <small>(or program)</small> those <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;This maximizes competition and minimizes <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> while causing <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion to be focused on "<a href="use.htm">use</a> value" instead of "exchange value".<br/>
<br/>
If <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is treated as an investment from the <a href="user.htm">user</a> who paid it, a business can become and remain open even as it scales to outcompete the dinosaurs who continue with raw capitalism.<br/>

Hello Marcin,<br/>
<br/>
I have been aware of your <a href="work.htm">work</a> since you had <a class="ext" href="http://SourceOpen.org">SourceOpen.org</a> and am very impressed that you have been able to actually begin physical <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this will grow out of control <small>(out of the control of the originators)</small>...<br/>
<br/>
I have some criticism directed at your claim that you intend to <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el the business after Open <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e, and I hope it can be considered by you with care.<br/>
<br/>
I am a religious follower of the <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>het Saint IGNUcius.&nbsp;&nbsp;His wisdom enforced through the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment has made <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software a competitor that <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>rietary corporations can no longer ignore.<br/>
<br/>
If we are to <a href="emu.htm">emu</a>late this social movement, it is important to understand what <a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom is and what it means for <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es to be open.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">== Developers Vs. <a href="user.htm">User</a>s or <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers Vs. Consumers ==</span><br/>
<br/>
OSE/Neocommercialization appears to be taking the stance of most any other <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>e Of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion intending to overtake Capitalism when it assumes the organization/business must be <a href="work.htm">Work</a>er <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ed.<br/>
<br/>
But I am convinced this is not nearly optimal.<br/>
<br/>
Some interesting things occur when Consumers <small>(or <a href="user.htm">User</a>s)</small> are <a href="own.htm">own</a> the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, even when they are not <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>ed enough to operate them that don't occur through <a href="work.htm">work</a>er <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> The consumer <a href="own.htm">own</a>s the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t even before it is <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ed.&nbsp;&nbsp;This causes <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e to be minimized.<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Wages are separated from <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>: A <a href="work.htm">work</a>er-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er may otherwise overpay himself and disallow competing <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers from accessing the <a href="land.htm">Land</a> and Capital <small>(Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es needed for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion)</small>, thereby keeping <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e Above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Abundance and <a href="real.htm">real</a> solutions are goal and never thought 'destructive'.<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Scarcity is not sought and those physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es are <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance.<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Un<a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ment is not a problem, it is the s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>d goal.<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> <a href="work.htm">Work</a> is to be eliminated as a hurdle on the road to riches.<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Low <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es are always good and tend toward <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is meaningless except as consumer growth.<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Entire <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion chains are finally localized.<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Development is solved instead of being sustained.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the world of Software, it is the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s <small>(consumers)</small> that are guaranteed access to the <a href="virt.htm">Virt</a>ual <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.&nbsp;&nbsp;Access is not confined to developers who happen to possess the <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s needed to operate <small>(program)</small> those <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
When the consumers <small>(<a href="user.htm">user</a>s)</small> have control, they are always able to "go around" any <a href="own.htm">own</a>er/developer that is attempting to overcharge them while claiming those charges are merely wage.&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition is maximized when mere consumers are in charge.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mak.htm">Mak</a>ing <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers does not solve this problem.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some quotes to support my claim:<br/>
<br/>
"Three Minutes with Ric<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> <a href="stallman.htm">Stallman</a>" ''With <a href="free.htm">free</a> software, the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s are in control.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the time, <a href="user.htm">user</a>s want interoperability, and when the software is <a href="free.htm">free</a>, they get what they want.&nbsp;&nbsp;With non-<a href="free.htm">free</a> software, the developer controls the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;The developer permits interoperability when that suits the developer; what the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s want is beside the point.'' -- <a class="ext" href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,137098-c,freeware/article.html">http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,137098-c,freeware/article.html</a><br/>
<br/>
"When we talk about <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter <a href="user.htm">user</a>s' <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom, we mean <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter <a href="user.htm">user</a>s -- not <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter programmers, not the most powerful people in society," -- Peter Brown at <a class="ext" href="http://ITManagement.EarthWeb.com/article.php/31771_3683791_3">http://ITManagement.EarthWeb.com/article.php/31771_3683791_3</a><br/>
<br/>
And a short video supporting the opposite view = the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a that developers <small>(<a href="work.htm">work</a>ers)</small> are the most important: <a class="ext" href="http://YouTube.com/watch?v=8zEQhhaJsU4">http://YouTube.com/watch?v=8zEQhhaJsU4</a><br/>

<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers may lock gates closed for exclusive private <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.<br/>
Or they may open them a bit for access that is <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>rietary.<br/>
<br/>
Even <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers that want a perfectly inclusive public utility,<br/>
must be able to exclude those that would destroy the community.<br/>
<br/>
So how do we <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d the perfect restaurant,<br/>
that helps hungry eat while keeping dirty hands out?<br/>
<br/>
Who is it that determines when something is good or bad?<br/>
It's the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers that decide, but how did get that badge?<br/>
<br/>
They organized first.&nbsp;&nbsp;They invested and took risk.<br/>
They are the <a href="own.htm">OWN</a>ERS dammit!&nbsp;&nbsp;To exclude is their right!<br/>
<br/>
But again, just what if.&nbsp;&nbsp;What if we <a href="start.htm">start</a>ed again?<br/>
Could we figure this out?&nbsp;&nbsp;Could it ever be right<small>[eous]</small>?<br/>
<br/>
What about the Johnny-Come-Late?&nbsp;&nbsp;The non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ing <a href="work.htm">work</a>er?<br/>
Can he ever progress, or will he be forever a serf?<br/>
<br/>
If he cannot gain <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership himself,<br/>
he will never have say; he will never have vote.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>osal I have is that <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is good.<br/>
But only if <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="user.htm">user</a>s can somehow gain ground.<br/>
<br/>
In the '<a href="real.htm">real</a> world' an investment is made<br/>
when a consumer <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s more than it <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> to create.<br/>
<br/>
Wages are a <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>, so don't worry about that.<br/>
But <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> should be treated as a plea for more growth.<br/>
<br/>
This is more <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult 'online', where <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s are still <a href="real.htm">real</a>,<br/>
but so small that collecting from each <a href="user.htm">user</a> is too annoying.<br/>
<br/>
WE <small>(the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s)</small> need a way to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s<br/>
to the collective others that will organize with US.<br/>
<br/>
WE also need a way to bid against each other,<br/>
and <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> more than <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> when the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty WE <a href="own.htm">own</a> is not yet enough.<br/>
<br/>
WE will treat the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment of <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> as a <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty retainer,<br/>
and any a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> above as that same <a href="user.htm">user</a>'s investment.<br/>
<br/>
This way joint <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty can finally be <a href="free.htm">free</a>.<br/>
<a href="free.htm">Free</a> as in <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom, though never 0.<br/>

You say <span class="quot">"'consider the commercial'"</span> as though <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e must remain above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>, yet then go on to say the opposite.&nbsp;&nbsp;Could you tell me more specifically what you mean by that phrase?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">"'using investment for improved service.'"</span><br/>
<br/>
I guess you are talking about treating <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as investment?<br/>
<br/>
This is fine *only* if those investments finally become the <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of the humans that paid them.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">"'or <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing it <a href="back.htm">back</a> to the trustees <small>(customers of the service they’re providing)</small>'"</span><br/>
<br/>
I don't think we can just hand the <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> <a href="back.htm">back</a> to those <a href="user.htm">user</a>s either.&nbsp;&nbsp;We, the originators understand the importance of growing the cooperative which requires the purchase of *MORE* <a href="land.htm">land</a> and capital.<br/>
<br/>
Customers <small>(<a href="user.htm">user</a>s)</small> generally don't <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly <a href="know.htm">know</a> how or what to invest in <small>(otherwise we wouldn't have this problem)</small>, and are unlikely to do so anyway because the corporate media has taught them poor judgement and desire for immediate satisfaction <small>(<a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y in the pocket)</small> over sound planning <small>(investing in their <a href="own.htm">own</a> future <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">"'These do sort of already exist, in the form of cooperatives.'"</span><br/>
Unfortunately, almost every 'cooperative' on earth subscribes to the faulty notion that the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership must be in the hands of those that happen to have the <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s to operate it instead of being <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by those that need the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e will never meet <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> and <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> will remain mixed with wages as long as the act of <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing determines the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership <small>(and therefore control)</small> of the means of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">"'Farmer’s markets are certainly staging a come<a href="back.htm">back</a> in <a href="part.htm">part</a>s of the US as the food supply becomes–and is recognized as–more industrialized.'"</span><br/>
These are better than the filth from ConAgra, Nestle, etc., but still are not optimum because it is almost universally taken as apriori that the <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers must be the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, instead of understanding that control must be in the hands of the <a href="user.htm">User</a>s that need the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t even though they may not happen to have those exact <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
Farm <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers <small>(and all small businesses)</small> have a terribly <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult time because they must hold the entire debt themselves, while the collective consumers could do this so much easier that they might even have a chance of actually <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing off the <a href="bank.htm">bank</a>!<br/>

Using the word 'value' to represent '<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>' is tremendously confusing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is nothing more than "<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>".&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would we <small>(anyone seeking to solve the <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic troubles we face)</small> want to keep <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>?&nbsp;&nbsp;Must we perpetuate poverty to <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>?<br/>
<br/>
If everyone in world had "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" access to bread, would you say bread has no value?&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll bet the starving Hatians wouldn't <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Isn't "<a href="use.htm">use</a> value" worth considering?<br/>
<br/>
Of course things lose "exchange value" as we approach abundance, but that only proves that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is an inverse measure of development.<br/>
<br/>
We don't NEED to keep <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> when the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s and the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers are the same set.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wage is also a <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>, and <a href="work.htm">work</a> is paid before <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is even <a href="calc.htm">calc</a>ulated.<br/>

<br/>
Axel,<br/>
<br/>
You say:<br/>
"This requires us to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> attention no longer mainly to who <a href="own.htm">own</a>s the means of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, but to ask a <a href="new.htm">new</a> question: who controls the means of produsage?"<br/>
<br/>
But you haven’t shown <small>(and I doubt that it could be shown)</small> that <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers do not control.<br/>
<br/>
The answer to your question of "who controls?" is, in fact, "the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers".<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you meant to ask a <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> question?<br/>
<br/>
In what way, or when are the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of the *physical* means of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion not the controllers?&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that ever true?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you are suggesting that a 'commons' <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el would be designed so that the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers would somehow not be in control, but I don’t see that happening.&nbsp;&nbsp;When push comes to shove, it is ALWAYS the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers that have the final say.<br/>
<br/>
This may seem like a bad situation, as <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers generally tend to eventually turn against the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s they claim to be 'serving', but I have an <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a about how we could <a href="use.htm">use</a> regular <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty rights to <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d a commons through a more careful form of sharing <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>t upon the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>als of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;I won't outline that <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>osal here, as this post is probably already considered too long.<br/>
<br/>
I am very interested in your thoughts on this, and will check <a href="back.htm">back</a> here for your reply.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please e<a href="mail.htm">mail</a> me directly if you like.<br/>

<br/>
Your requirement "it has to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e sense to an alien visitor" may be a problem for a more discerning race because Kurt Godel's first "incompleteness theorem" <a class="ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems</a> appears to require any system to be either inconsistent or incomplete.<br/>
<br/>
So, <small>(if my interpretation is correct)</small>, religion can be EITHER consistent <small>(does not con<a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ict itself)</small>, or it can be complete <small>(can be proven from data wholly from within itself)</small>, but it can't be simultaneously both.<br/>
<br/>
Since most adhe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>s would want to claim their religion doesn't con<a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ict itself, then that religion must be incomplete, and therefore would require proof OUTSIDE of itself to prove or disprove it's validity.<br/>
<br/>
Notice Godel's theorem can't be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to prove or disprove the validity of the system itself, it is only <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to prove or disprove the *decidability* of that system. In other words, if an adhe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> claims his system <small>(religion)</small> is consistent, but is only willing to consider data <small>(scripture)</small> from within that system, then the system cannot be decided - it can be neither proven nor disproven until external information <small>(such as physical evidence)</small> is presented.<br/>

Hello Ned, Michel and all researchers,<br/>

<span class="quot">> those tensions can ever be 'solved'.</span><br/>
<br/>
I'd like to ask a question that may seem too stupid to be worth answering, but I wonder if the reason it hasn't occured to us is because it is just too obvious to consider.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First, a claim about <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership:<br/>
1. == When <a href="user.htm">user</a>s are <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, tension is 'fair'<br/>
In some <small>(usually very small)</small> cases, the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s and the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers are actually the same set of people.&nbsp;&nbsp;If each of those <a href="user.htm">user</a>s has as much vote-control <small>(as measured by the percentage of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership they hold)</small> needed to accomplish the goals they desire, then conflicts could only be structured as: <small>[a subset of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers vs. another subset of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers]</small>.<br/>
<br/>
This levels the playing field, and avoids the uneven case we are usually fighting: <small>[a subset of non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ing <a href="user.htm">user</a>s vs. a subset of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers]</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
S<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>d, a claim about scale:<br/>
2. == <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> should be treated as an investment from the <a href="user.htm">user</a> who <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s it<br/>
<a href="user.htm">User</a>s <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <small>(even if just through excessive exposure to unwanted advertising and lack of <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom)</small> when they don't have <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, so <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> should be understood as a plea for growth, and may be 'balanced' by treating it as an investment from the specific <a href="user.htm">user</a> that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s it.&nbsp;&nbsp;By doing this, <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership flows continuously to those who are willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for it - thereby holding the first claim <small>(#1)</small> "in place" in a sort of self-correcting dynamic.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Third, a question about implementation:<br/>
3. == While Copy<a href="left.htm">left</a> jujitsu requires Copyright, <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty<a href="left.htm">left</a> will require <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty rights<br/>
Could we write a contract similar in spirit to the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> that describes #2 in legal language, and then apply that contract to some of our <a href="own.htm">OWN</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty - maybe as a kind of corporate "Terms of Operation" so that <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom is guaranteed for all <a href="user.htm">user</a>s by causing each and every <a href="user.htm">user</a> to incrementally become <a href="part.htm">part</a>ial <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers <small>(and simultaneously be growing the organization)</small> whenever they <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> As I <a href="note.htm">note</a> in my response to Daren's review, another challenge for</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> governance is scale.</span><br/>
<br/>
If some of us were to <a href="start.htm">start</a> a small business or organization and become <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers ourselves, we could choose to steer the power we might be otherwise tempted to hold against <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="user.htm">user</a>s so the system would scale as control is contiuously distributed.<br/>
<br/>
Allowing every <a href="user.htm">user</a> *<a href="real.htm">real</a>* <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership over the investments they <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for <small>(as measured by the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> they <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> above <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion)</small> would enable <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing subgroups to 'fork' whenever they thought they were large enough to survive on their <a href="own.htm">own</a>, and would also <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e the whole organization couldn't suddenly be aquired by a big-fish, since each <a href="user.htm">user</a> would have <a href="real.htm">real</a> and divisible <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership <small>(<a href="note.htm">note</a>: <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership would NOT be equal, because some <a href="user.htm">user</a>s are very active and willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <small>(invest)</small> alot, while others may be willing to spend very little time, energy or <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> The very existence of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers/sysops indicates the non-<a href="part.htm">part</a>icipatory</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> <small>(or at least closed circle)</small> dimension of <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>s.</span><br/>
<br/>
Maybe <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership isn't the problem per-se; maybe the problem is more about WHO the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers are.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice, that while Ric<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> <a href="stallman.htm">Stallman</a> dislikes how Copyright is usually <a href="use.htm">use</a>d, he didn't abandon it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, he <a href="use.htm">use</a>d it in a subversive manner to <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e every <a href="user.htm">user</a> would have control of the '<a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual' means of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe we could do something similar with <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty to <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e every <a href="user.htm">user</a> gains control over the 'physical' means of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> There is</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> frequently very little communication/<a href="part.htm">part</a>icipation between <a href="admin.htm">admin</a>s and</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> <a href="user.htm">user</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;And most are fine with this relation. Who wants to clear our</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> spam every day on a <a href="mail.htm">mail</a>ing list for example, or attend to the</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> numerous <a href="admin.htm">admin</a> requests to process postings from non-subscribers</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> <small>(which this list still has a strangely high a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of)</small>?</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We would still need to hire <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>ed personell whenever we couldn't do it ourselves, but at least we would have the reins, and could fire them if they ever tried to act against us.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> The other obvious thing to <a href="note.htm">note</a> is that the culture of governance</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> varies considerably across widely adopted applications. Geert Lovink</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> documents this well in his analysis of <a href="mail.htm">mail</a>ing list cultures. This</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> points to the fact that a universal <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el of <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> governance will</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> never exist.</span><br/>
<br/>
Yes, there will always be individual and group idio<a href="sync.htm">sync</a>racies, but those conflicts will be more 'fair' when each <a href="user.htm">user</a> is gaining <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>

<br/>
Hello Todd and Max,<br/>
<br/>
I'm happy to hear someone willing to consider the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a enough to think it through.<br/>
<br/>
I am not quoting anyone here, this is my <a href="own.htm">own</a> claim based on research I've been <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing on since late 1999.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I didn't *invent* the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a, it is simply truth that was in need of discovery - like gravity or friction.<br/>
<br/>
I don't <a href="know.htm">know</a> if this information was purposefully hidden from us, or if we accidentally lost it, but it is unfortunate that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is now treated as 'earnings' when it is much more clear to understand it as a plea from growth from the consumer who <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s it.<br/>
<br/>
A consumer <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s a high <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e for nuts and berries not because those things are 'inhe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ly' expensive, but because they do not yet have <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es <small>(<a href="land.htm">land</a>, plants, water rights)</small> of those things.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you <a href="own.htm">own</a> an almond tree, you might <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> someone to tend it and to bring in the harvest <small>(and treat those wages as a <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>)</small>, but it would be impossible to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> unless you were to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> it to yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is UNDEFINED in the special case where the consumer has <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the means of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <small>(physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es)</small> required for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion - even if that consumer does not possess the <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s required to operate those <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
Corporations already <a href="calc.htm">calc</a>ulate <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between Consumer_<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e and <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s, while <a href="work.htm">Work</a>er_Wages are one of those <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
Consumers ALREADY <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s <small>(including wages)</small>, and they ALSO <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> because of the 'pressure' created by their lack of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es required for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> depends upon rivalry for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t initially, and rivalry of physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es finally, and can only be "held in place" for as long as the consumer is not able to figure out how to have <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the physical means of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion required for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
We <small>(the consumers)</small> suffer this because we have not yet figured out a way to organize amongst ourselves, so let the corporations take advantage of our lack of development.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever one of us decides to <a href="start.htm">start</a> a business intending to solve this problem, we are not able to do so because we hold the pre-concieved notion that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is a reward to be won instead of understanding it to be an inverse measure of competition, and therefore a direct measure of <a href="part.htm">part</a>ial monopoly.<br/>
<br/>
Competition is maximized and <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> minimized when consumers gain control through <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, and <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> happens to measure how far we are from reaching that goal.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I write alot about this stuff, but my <a href="own.htm">own</a> psychological issues <small>(we all have them)</small> <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e them <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult to digest.<br/>

PS: About religion: I'm not just being cranky, I've given this plenty of thought, and have recently <small>(because of the exchange with Max)</small> found there may be a way of PROVING that no religion is meaningful without physical evidence according to Kurt Godel's "Theory of Incompleteness" can be summarized as: No description of a system can be simultaneously consistent and complete.<br/>
