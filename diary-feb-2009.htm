<br/>
<span class="h2">==The Utilization/<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e Ratio for SINGULAR <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership:</span><br/>
<br/>
Why do people choose to BUY some tools,<br/>
while they choose to <a href="rent.htm">RENT</a> others?<br/>
<br/>
When a person can <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e <a href="use.htm">use</a> of <small>(utilize)</small> a <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine<br/>
to a sufficient degree, it is more efficient for them to<br/>
<a href="own.htm">OWN</a> instead of <a href="rent.htm">RENT</a>.<br/>
<br/>
But wait, how could that be?&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="own.htm">own</a>er <small>(whoever he is)</small> must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all<br/>
<a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s either way.<br/>
<br/>
A <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>al agency must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for the initial<br/>
investment, upkeep/repair/maintenance/wear,<br/>
<a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance, <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ion/security, <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age, taxes,<br/>
and any wages to any <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers needed to do any<br/>
of those things.<br/>
<br/>
A private <a href="own.htm">own</a>er must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> those exact same <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s,<br/>
so how could it possibly be cheaper to <a href="own.htm">own</a> outright<br/>
instead of <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ing?<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence is called '<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>'.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s an <a href="own.htm">own</a>er <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s<br/>
and the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e a consumer is willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>.<br/>
<br/>
When the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er and consumer are the same person,<br/>
there is no such thing as <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
That is the savings in <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership over <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>al.<br/>
<br/>
----<br/>
<br/>
But what about <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hines that are not "worth it" to<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a> because that individual <a href="own.htm">own</a>er cannot sufficiently<br/>
utilize them?<br/>
<br/>
It must be worth it for SOMEONE to <a href="own.htm">own</a> them,<br/>
otherwise the <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>al agency wouldn't do so.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence here is a matter of utilization.<br/>
<br/>
So how can a consumer increase the utilization<br/>
of a tool to the point of <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership "worth it"?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==The Utilization/<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e Ratio for <a href="co-own.htm">CO-own</a>ership:</span><br/>
One way is to buy the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine with a group of<br/>
other consumers.<br/>
<br/>
Organizing with your neighbors to <a href="own.htm">OWN</a> a roto-tiller<br/>
instead of continuing to <a href="rent.htm">RENT</a> is cheaper if that<br/>
equipment can be kept sufficiently 'busy'.<br/>
<br/>
These savings are often overlooked as being the result<br/>
of not <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing Wages to <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers, but that <a href="work.htm">work</a> must<br/>
be done either way, and we <a href="know.htm">know</a> the <a href="rent.htm">Rent</a>al agency<br/>
or the Capitalist <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>er enjoys <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> while<br/>
<a href="calc.htm">calc</a>ulating Wages as a <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>, so where is the confusion?<br/>
<br/>
For example: Let's say a for-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> business has hired<br/>
<a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ees to go door-to-door offering to roto-till a<br/>
garden patch.<br/>
<br/>
The business <a href="own.htm">own</a>er offers the service for some fee -<br/>
say $1 per square meter while <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing the <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ee<br/>
operating the tiller say $10 per hour.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="own.htm">own</a>er has other <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s such as management, initial investment,<br/>
gasoline, oil, replacing <a href="part.htm">part</a>s, <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age, <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance, and maybe many<br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
But we <a href="know.htm">know</a> he is charging more that these <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s if he<br/>
is reporting a <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> - for that is the definition of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> =<br/>
"<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>".<br/>
<br/>
Now let's look at what happens when the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of the<br/>
<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <small>(the tiller)</small> are also the consumers of the outputs<br/>
<small>(the tilled ground)</small>: They must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the same <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s as<br/>
the Capitalist, including Wages to the operator and<br/>
mechanics, but they wouldn't be <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing the extra a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a><br/>
called <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> - for who could they possibly <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> it to?<br/>
<br/>
When the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es are Consumer-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ed, they could probably <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers slightly more <small>(say $12 per hour)</small> and *still* <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> less since<br/>
they wouldn't be <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing the unnecessary burden of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
There is <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a> involved in the act of organization,<br/>
but that <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <small>(wages to management)</small> must be paid<br/>
either way.<br/>
<br/>
So what is keeping us from organizing and cooperatively<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ing <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hines, <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>dings, even <a href="land.htm">land</a>?<br/>
<br/>
I think <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the problem is a long-standing belief that<br/>
whoever possesses the <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s to operate those <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hines<br/>
should be the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
But doesn't the above argument show that efficiency<br/>
<small>(as in the lowest <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e)</small> comes when <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is in<br/>
the hands of those that consume the final output?<br/>
<br/>
Another <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the problem is in figuring out how those<br/>
re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es should be shared among the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
It is a <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult, sticky situation that most people would<br/>
rather just avoid altogether because of the forecasted<br/>
in-fighting they perceive would occur.<br/>
<br/>
It seems such a group could write some 'rules' about<br/>
how to schedule access, and how much each individual<br/>
must compensate the others for any extra wear or exclusion<br/>
they cause.<br/>
<br/>
I see such a contract, if '<a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ly' written, would be the only<br/>
thing our society needs to begin down the road of<br/>
peace and abundance.<br/>
<br/>
A single <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine can be shared among a finite number<br/>
of people.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the number of consumers attempting to<br/>
utilize the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine increases, at some point it will be<br/>
impossible to fullfill those requests with a single <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine.<br/>
<br/>
If the collective <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers have the time-sharing of that<br/>
<a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine setup so that anyone wanting to <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> it are<br/>
bidding against each other, then more time slots will be filled.<br/>
<br/>
People that want to <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> close to '<a href="cost.htm">cost</a>', and are willing to lose some<br/>
sleep will <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> at 2am, while other people will be willing to "fight<br/>
it out" for a slot at 12 noon in a bid war.<br/>
<br/>
As the dueling bidders raise their <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e for that time<br/>
slot, they are *proving* that the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent number of <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hines cannot<br/>
fill peak demand, and - since that "<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" will be invested<br/>
for the winning bidder toward buying ANOTHER <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine, the 'system'<br/>
should be self-stablizing as those extra <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ments will be invested<br/>
toward another <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine until the number of <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hines is sufficient to<br/>
cover the needs of that community.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, each sub-community that develops around each of those<br/>
<a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hines can then secede from the whole if they decide to treat their<br/>
<a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine in a <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> manner <small>(say changing the oil more often)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Cooperative consumer <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is quite rare today, but there are a<br/>
few cases where a group of friends wanting a private airplane <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e a<br/>
"shared investment", and then <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> the plane from the collective<br/>
others whenever they want to <a href="use.htm">use</a> it.&nbsp;&nbsp;None of those people need the<br/>
ability to fly themselves, they can just hire a pilot and <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> that<br/>
wage as a <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> while still saving <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y by not <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Another example is shared <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of a vacation house.&nbsp;&nbsp;The<br/>
for-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> "Time Share" industry has grown around that desire, but I'm<br/>
referring to the less common case when a private group of people buy a<br/>
house that they share amongst themselves in whatever way they see fit.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<hr/><span class="date">Feb-17-2009:</span> <span class="quot">"'<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> requires an imperfect market'"</span> posted to <a class="ext" href="http://Groups.Google.com/group/postscarcity/browse_thread/thread/b423dad382da81a5/0e7a37f5a59550f0">Groups.Google.com/group/postscarcity/browse_thread/thread/b423dad382da81a5/0e7a37f5a59550f0</a> <br/>
<br/>
<a href="part.htm">Part</a> of <a class="ext" href="http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_competition">http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_competition</a> reads:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">"'... it is impossible for a firm in perfect competition to earn<br/>
<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> in the long run, which is to say that a firm cannot<br/>
<a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e any more <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y than is necessary to cover its <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s.'"</span><br/>
<br/>
But, since normal, for-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> business measure success by the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a><br/>
they can keep <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>, truly perfect competition brought<br/>
about by Consumer <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ed enterprises would <a href="spell.htm">spell</a> certain disaster - for<br/>
all Capitalist would then close their doors proclaiming failure!<br/>
<br/>
A business must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> it's inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s SOMETHING, otherwise, why would<br/>
they invest?&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s are expecting <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>, then they<br/>
require the business they invested in to be able to operate in an<br/>
imperfect market.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is a measure of this imperfection.<br/>
<br/>
But there is another thing that we could <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s if those<br/>
inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s are in a certain set.<br/>
<br/>
If the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s are also CONSUMERS <small>(some could incidentally be<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>ers too)</small> of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t being <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed, then they would be<br/>
satisfied with receiving <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t alone, and would never need the<br/>
business to keep <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
When the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion are the consumers of the output, the<br/>
organization can withstand perfect competition because those that<br/>
pre-paid will expect <a href="produc.htm">PRODUC</a>T instead of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In contrast, if the all inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s are all <a href="work.htm">WORK</a>ERS <small>(some could<br/>
incidentally be consumers too)</small>, and the market has perfect<br/>
competition, then the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers would be paid the same wages as any<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>er that was not an <a href="own.htm">own</a>er, yet would have the risk of holding the<br/>
debt of that incorporation.<br/>
<br/>
If you say "Well, they would be consumers too, so would also be paid<br/>
in <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t" then you are describing why consumers should be the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers<br/>
of the Means Of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion and avoiding the issue of whether <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership<br/>
should be limited to those that happen to have the <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s to operate<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
If you say "Well, the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers could <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> themselves a higher wage than<br/>
non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ing <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers" then you are talking about how <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> would be<br/>
'hidden' in those wages since <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers can arbitrarily <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e that<br/>
division.&nbsp;&nbsp;But in that case, the organization would be less efficient<br/>
than "consumer <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed" - since, when many of the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers are not<br/>
neccessarily <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers, then wages and <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> are cleanly and clearly<br/>
separated.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a <a href="work.htm">work</a>er tried to collect too high of a wage for the<br/>
quality of <a href="work.htm">work</a> he was supplying, then the collective <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers would put<br/>
that <a href="job.htm">job</a> up for reverse-bid <small>(just as <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ers do today)</small> until a<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>er with a better quality-to-wage ratio was found.<br/>

<span class="quot">> Now, I personally am very confused by all this.</span><br/>
<br/>
I <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to be very confused about <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omics until I went <a href="back.htm">back</a> and<br/>
r<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>sidered our base assumption about the supposed 'need' to<br/>
perpetuate <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Since <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> *requires* scarcity, there is no possible way we can have<br/>
both <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> AND abundance.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are mutually exclusive.<br/>
<br/>
It may seem that any <a href="own.htm">own</a>er must keep <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> for it to be<br/>
'worth' the investment, but there is actually one case where the<br/>
inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a> can be paid in *<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t* instead - leaving us to find a <a href="new.htm">new</a><br/>
purpose and destination for that surplus value.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, this special <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>e of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion I allude to also solves<br/>
the supposed 'need' to perpetuate <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Edward, are you willing to r<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>sider the treatment of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> for <a href="new.htm">new</a><br/>

Since communities are dynamic* across time, <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ing members remain<br/>
the "actual and only <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers" of the Material Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion needs<br/>
a non-<a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ic solution.<br/>
<br/>
This temporal complexity requires we consider factors that are<br/>
<a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itionally outside the scope of limitations for simple <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.&nbsp;&nbsp;While regular <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership can be a stepping-stone<br/>
toward such an organization, there is also a 'bad' side to <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership<br/>
that we must guard against lest we arrive in the typical centralized<br/>
configuration...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>ntified the primary factor in need of adjustment, and cr<a href="edit.htm">edit</a><br/>
most of that 'generalizing' the concepts of <a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom as outlined<br/>
by Ric<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> <a href="stallman.htm">Stallman</a>, and specifically the requirement that <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect<br/>
<a href="user.htm">User</a>s <small>(<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t Consumers)</small> gain "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" access to the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es<br/>
<small>(Material Means)</small> of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t even when they do NOT <a href="know.htm">know</a> how to<br/>
'operate' those <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
Observe that '<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>' <small>(literally "Consumer <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e" - "<a href="own.htm">Own</a>er <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s")</small><br/>
arises only when the Consumer does not yet have enough <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership.&nbsp;&nbsp;For<br/>
example: when you <a href="own.htm">own</a> an apple tree, you might <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers to tend it,<br/>
but those wages are but a <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> that any <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;But every<br/>
<a href="own.htm">Own</a>er is able to 'escape' the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> - for who would they<br/>
<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> it to?<br/>
<br/>
So, when a <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er/Member sells something to someone else that<br/>
has insufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, that <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er has the 'opportunity' to charge<br/>
a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <small>(to <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>[<small>[remember, Wages are not <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>,<br/>
Wages are a <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion]</small>]</small>.<br/>
<br/>
But if such a community allows <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> to be treated as a 'reward' for<br/>
that <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>er <small>(as Capitalism does)</small>, then that <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>er will<br/>
aquire even *more* <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty as he invests that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> into more<br/>
Material Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion, while the Consumer who made that<br/>
overpayment will be <a href="left.htm">left</a> with nothing but the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t he overpaid for.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> can be thought of as a "plea for growth" from the Consumer who<br/>
paid it.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Consumer's dependence upon the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
He is saying "look, I'll <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> you more than it <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <small>(<a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s<br/>
include wages)</small> to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e this beer because I don't <a href="own.htm">own</a> the equipment,<br/>
and am not organized enough to hire those with the <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s - otherwise<br/>
I could get it "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>"".<br/>
<br/>
I'm not saying we shouldn't charge <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> <small>(for to do so would stop<br/>
growth altogether)</small>, but only that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> should be understood as a<br/>
measure of consumer dependence that needs to be 'balanced' if we are<br/>
to remain "Member Managed" - for otherwise only the originators will<br/>
<a href="own.htm">Own</a> <small>(and therefore manage)</small>, while the latecomers will be a dependent<br/>
group that can only beg for recognition.<br/>
<br/>
In conclusion: While <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership appears to be a direct<br/>
solution to "Member Managed" problem, it is incomplete unless "<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e<br/>
above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" <small>(<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> is treated as an investment from the Consumer who<br/>
paid it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
----<br/>
<small>(*)</small> Some of the dynamism we must consider:<br/>
1.)</small> The total number of members grows and shrinks as members join or leave.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> Members desire <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> *types* of "goods and services" which may<br/>
require the purchase of <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> <small>(more)</small> Material Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
3.)</small> Members desire <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> quantities of "goods and services" which<br/>
requires their <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership rise and fall to match their consumption.<br/>
