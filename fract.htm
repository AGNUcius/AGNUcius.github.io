<br/>
<a class="ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_Ownership">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_Ownership</a> <span class="quot">"'In business, <a href="fract.htm">fract</a>ional <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is a percentage share of an expensive asset.

<a class="ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_estate">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_estate</a> <span class="quot">"'A con<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent e<a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e or co-tenancy is a concept in <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty law, <a href="part.htm">part</a>icularly derived from the common law of <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, which describes the various ways in which <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty can be <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by more than one person at a given time. The <a href="part.htm">part</a>ies who <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty jointly are referred to as co-tenants or joint tenants. Most common-law jurisdictions recognize three kinds of con<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent e<a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e: tenancy in common, joint tenancy with right of survivorship, and tenancy by the entirety. Many jurisdictions simply refer to a joint tenancy with right of survivorship as a joint tenancy, but a few U.S. <a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>es treat the phrase joint tenancy as synonymous with a tenancy in common.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Co-tenants, irrespective of the type of tenancy, share certain rights relative to each other and to the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, except to the extent they have <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified these rights through an <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment among themselves:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 1. Each tenant has an unrestricted right of access to the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty. Where one co-tenant wrongfully excludes another from <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing <a href="use.htm">use</a> of the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, the excluded co-tenant can bring a cause of action for ouster,', and may receive the fair <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>al value of the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty for the time that he was dispossessed.<br/>
&nbsp; 2. Each tenant has a right to an accounting of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s made from the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty. If the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty generates income such as <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>, each tenant is en<a href="title.htm">title</a>d to a pro-rata share of that income.<br/>
&nbsp; 3. Each tenant has a right of contribution for the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty. Co-tenants can be forced to contribute to the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment of expenses such as <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty taxes and mortgages on the entire <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
Co-tenants do not have any obligation to contribute to any <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of repairing or improving the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty. If one co-tenant adds a feature that enhances the value of the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, that co-tenant has no right to demand that any others share the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of adding that feature - even if other co-tenants reap greater <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s from the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty because of it. However, at <a href="part.htm">part</a>ition, a co-tenant is en<a href="title.htm">title</a>d to <a href="recover.htm">recover</a> the value added by his or her improvements of the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty. Conversely, if the co-tenant's "improvements" decrease the value of the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, the co-tenant is responsible for those decreases as well.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, each co-tenant can independently encumber the co-tenant's <a href="own.htm">own</a> share in the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty by taking out a mortgage on that share <small>(although this may effectively convert a joint tenancy to a tenancy in common, as described below)</small>; other co-tenants have no obligation to help <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> a mortgage that only runs to another tenant's share of the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, and the mortgagee can only foreclose on that mortgagor's share. <a href="bank.htm">Bank</a> loans secured by mortgages on individual shares of <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ed <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty is one of the most rapidly expanding areas in the mortgage lending industry.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, co-tenants owe one another a duty of fair dealing. Because of this, any co-tenant who acquires a mortgage claim against the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty must give his co-tenants a reasonable opportunity to purchase <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ortionate shares in that claim.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Tenancy in common<br/>
<br/>
Tenancy in common is the default form of con<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent e<a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e, in which each <a href="own.htm">own</a>er, referred to as a tenant in common, is regarded by the law as each <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing separate and distinct shares which may <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>er in size. This form of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is common where the <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers are not married or have contributed <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a>s to the acquisition of the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty. Also, if joint <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers had attempted to <a href="use.htm">use</a> another form of joint <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership such as a joint tenancy with right of survivorship or a tenancy by the entirety, and the effort was for some reason invalid, the joint <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers would then be tenants in common. If conclusive evidence is not available of the desire to create a tenancy with rights of survivorship or a tenancy by the entirety, courts will determine that a tenancy in common has in fact been created.<br/>
<br/>
Tenants in common have no right of survivorship, meaning that if one <a href="own.htm">own</a>er dies, that <a href="own.htm">own</a>er's interest in the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty will <a href="pass.htm">pass</a> by inheritance to that <a href="own.htm">own</a>er's devisees or heirs, either by will, or by inte<a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e succession.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Destruction of a tenancy in common<br/>
<br/>
Where any <a href="part.htm">part</a>y to a tenancy in common wishes to destroy the joint interest, he or she can do so through a <a href="part.htm">part</a>ition of the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty - a division of the <a href="land.htm">land</a> into distinctly <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed plots if such division is legally permitted based upon zoning and other local <a href="land.htm">land</a> <a href="use.htm">use</a> restrictions or, where such division is not permitted, a forced sale of the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty followed by a division of proceeds.<br/>
<br/>
If the <a href="part.htm">part</a>ies are unable to <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> to a <a href="part.htm">part</a>ition, any or all of them may seek the ruling of a court to determine how the <a href="land.htm">land</a> should be divided up, physically divide it between the joint <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers <small>(<a href="part.htm">part</a>ition in kind)</small>, leaving each with <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of a portion of the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty representing their share. Courts may also order a <a href="part.htm">part</a>ition by sale in which the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty is sold and the proceeds are distributed to the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers. Where local law does not permit physical division, the court must order a <a href="part.htm">part</a>ition by sale.<br/>
<br/>
Each <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>er is en<a href="title.htm">title</a>d to <a href="part.htm">part</a>ition as a matter of right, meaning that the court will order a <a href="part.htm">part</a>ition at the request of any of the <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers. The only exception to this general rule is where the <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers have <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>d, either expressly or impliedly, to waive the right of <a href="part.htm">part</a>ition. The right may be waived either permanently, for a specific period of time, or under certain conditions.'"</span><br/>
