The "Cross of <a href="gold.htm">Gold</a>" <a href="speech.htm">speech</a> was delivered by William Jennings Bryan at the 1896 Democratic National Convention on July 9, 1896 at the Chicago Coliseum in Chicago, Illinois.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this <a href="speech.htm">speech</a> it is evident that he wishes to have bimetallism.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Democratic <a href="part.htm">Part</a>y stood for standardizing the value of the United <a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>es dollar to silver and in opposition to the <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>osed pegging of the value of the dollar to <a href="gold.htm">gold</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bryan had once said before "<a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e the dollar so stable in its purchasing power that it will defraud neither debtor nor cr<a href="edit.htm">edit</a>or." the ones who supported inflation had looked to two <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es for addictional circulating <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency, like the Green<a href="back.htm">back</a>ers.&nbsp;&nbsp;The inflation that would result from the silver standard would <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e it easier for poor farmers to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> off their farm debts by increasing their revenue dollars.&nbsp;&nbsp;The deflation that would result from the <a href="gold.htm">gold</a> standard <a href="back.htm">back</a>ed by the Republicans would benefit <a href="bank.htm">bank</a>s by <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing it <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>er for their debtors to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="back.htm">back</a> their loans.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="speech.htm">speech</a> became famous and gets its name from its triumphant ending:<br/>

Having behind us the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing masses of this nation and the world, supported by the commercial interests, the laboring interests and the toilers everywhere, we will answer their demand for a <a href="gold.htm">gold</a> standard by saying to them: 'You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns, you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of <a href="gold.htm">gold</a>.<br/>

<br/>
This 7 Minute cartoon shows Felix <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing at the <span class="quot">"'RELIEF BUREAU'"</span> handing out coins sliced from <a href="gold.htm">Gold</a>ie's eggs to the appa<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ly poor people lining up for a handout.<br/>
<br/>
Captain Kid steals the bird and sings:<br/>
&nbsp; <span class="quot">"'We takes what we wants, and we wants what we takes, for we're pirates out looking for treasure.'"</span><br/>
&nbsp; <span class="quot">"'If we see any <a href="gold.htm">gold</a>, we steal it away, robbing widows and orphans of pleasure.'"</span><br/>
<br/>
Felix chases Kid and <a href="recover.htm">recover</a>s <a href="gold.htm">Gold</a>ie, then showers the city with coins from cannons.&nbsp;&nbsp;Citizens cleaning <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y from streets may seem nice, but is it?&nbsp;&nbsp;Doesn't the resolving power of each coin decrease as number of coins increases?<br/>
<br/>
What if every household had their <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="gold.htm">gold</a>-egg laying goose <small>(or counterfieting <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine)</small>?&nbsp;&nbsp;Who would do the <a href="work.htm">work</a>?&nbsp;&nbsp;What <a href="work.htm">work</a> could be done?&nbsp;&nbsp;What <a href="work.htm">work</a> must the poor do to meet their needs?<br/>

What if every household had their <a href="own.htm">own</a> food-egg laying goose <small>(or permaculture)</small> instead?&nbsp;&nbsp;Who would do the <a href="work.htm">work</a>?&nbsp;&nbsp;What <a href="work.htm">work</a> could be done?&nbsp;&nbsp;What <a href="work.htm">work</a> must be done?<br/>
<br/>
It's not that <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y is not a <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful tool.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful because it 'universalizes' <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e by causing one good or service to be easily exchanged for another.<br/>
<br/>
Like a community '<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>ehouse' where you "check in" your goods or "register" your services so that others may exchange with you...<br/>
