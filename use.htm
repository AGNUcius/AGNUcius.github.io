<br/>
Thanks for the letter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry for the slow response.<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad you have been thinking about this tricky thing.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to concentrate on defining the problem, but to do so requires us to do something that most people find too boring or irritating: we must de<a href="compile.htm">compile</a> and even disassemble the meanings hidden in the words we tend to <a href="use.htm">use</a> without enough care.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, you say:<br/>
<span class="quot2">>> Those sucka's are incredibly expensive!</span><br/>
<br/>
The word "expensive" here refers to the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e Consumers <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> after <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is complete.<br/>
<br/>
"<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e" is a composition of "<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>" + "<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>".<br/>
<br/>
"<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>" includes things like:<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span> Capital Investment: baby trees, tools, water rights, <a href="land.htm">land</a>.<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span> Wages to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers to plant, tend and harvest the trees.<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span> Re<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ing <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of fuel, oil and wear on the tools.<br/>
<br/>
"<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>" is what the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers are hi<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>ically 'en<a href="title.htm">title</a>d' to take from the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and is based on the combination of the vulnerability of both the Consumers and the <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
The potential for "<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>" is therefore a measure of the power <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers hold over non-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers.&nbsp;&nbsp;It describes the non-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers' dependence on <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
It may seem obvious then, that "<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>" is a problem that we should just try to eliminate.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the sad thing is that the success of a corporation is defined as the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> they are able to extract from us.&nbsp;&nbsp;So as "<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e" approaches "<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>", a business approaches failure.<br/>
<br/>
Another way to think about "<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>" is to understand it as a plea from Consumers to Grow and have Control.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consumer is saying "I can't get bread any other way, so am willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er more than it <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e it because I am in a bind.".<br/>
<br/>
In this way we see the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> called "<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>" would <small>(in a better world)</small> be an automatic investment for that Consumer in the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion needed to create more of that kind of <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consumer should become a <a href="part.htm">part</a>ial controlling shareholder in the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion for that <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect according to the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> he <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s above <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s, so, after each iteration, Consumers will move closer to being <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers in the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of the things <small>(plants, tools, water, <a href="land.htm">land</a>, etc.)</small> that are required to <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e their future needs are met.<br/>
<br/>
But, since people's tastes change, this should be an incremental and continuous process that happens anytime an <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect changes hands.<br/>
<br/>
Of course you <a href="know.htm">know</a> that if you <a href="own.htm">Own</a> a nut tree yourself, and are the only Consumer of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects of that tree, that "<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e" == "<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>", and "<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>" is meaningless.&nbsp;&nbsp;That does not mean you must be the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er.&nbsp;&nbsp;We very much want division of labor and specialization; and in many cases doing the <a href="work.htm">work</a> yourself is impossible because you simply don't have the <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership and labor is already separated in Capitalism, so this is no change at all.<br/>
<br/>
As <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect <a href="user.htm">User</a>s become <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers, <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ment can be safely minimized and there is no reason to hope other <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers fail, as abundance is always good, and scarcity is to be avoided.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the positive-feed<a href="back.htm">back</a> that can close the loop on an <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy and cause it to finally stabilize.<br/>
