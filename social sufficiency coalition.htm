There is a flaw in the allocation routines of our social <a href="operating system.htm">Operating System</a> that inefficiently centralizes control of collective holdings instead of causing that control to be distributed according to the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> each <a href="user.htm">user</a> <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itionally <a href="calc.htm">calc</a>ulated as the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e a consumer <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s, and the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es in<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ed during <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.&nbsp;&nbsp;This <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence should be understood as a plea from the <a href="user.htm">user</a> that paid it.<br/>
<br/>
Treating <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as an investment from the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er maximizes competition and drives <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e toward <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s and therefore <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> <small>(consumer investment)</small> toward zero while continuously distributing control as <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
Whether the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es <small>(means of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion)</small> are being managed as a public utility under a representative government or as <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>rietary holdings in a corporate setting, the consumers of the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects <small>(<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts)</small> of those <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es do not <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently gain or lose control in the dynamic manner needed to <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e control flows according to those willing to invest as measured by the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment of <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Because of this, initial inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s and organizers of governments and corporations <small>(even when non-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> retain too much vote weight which becomes a sort of power over newcomers and generally over those that do not otherwise organize for themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another effect is excessively coarse granularity in decision <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing and general loss of <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom that stymies <a href="real.htm">real</a>istic divisibility and direct democracy.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> is very clear in it's goal to <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e the <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <small>(<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code)</small> should be in the hands of the CONSUMERS.<br/>
<br/>
If a "<a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>e of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion" is defined by who controls the "Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion", then the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>e of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion is one in which the Consumers and NOT the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ers are at the helm.<br/>
<br/>
When <a href="rms.htm">RMS</a> speaks of <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom it is always about the <a href="user.htm">User</a> <small>(consumer)</small>, not developer, author, <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>er, <a href="work.htm">work</a>er or <a href="own.htm">own</a>er.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, <a class="ext" href="http://GNU.org/philosophy/freedom-or-power.html">GNU.org/philosophy/freedom-or-power.html</a> says <span class="quot">"'<a href="prop.htm">Prop</a>rietary software is an exercise of power. Copyright law today grants software developers that power, so they and only they choose the rules to impose on everyone else -- a relatively few people <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e the basic software decisions for everyone, typically by denying their <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom. When <a href="user.htm">user</a>s lack the <a href="free.htm">free</a>doms that define <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software, they can't tell what the software is doing, can't check for <a href="back.htm">back</a> doors, can't <a href="moni.htm">moni</a>tor possible viruses and worms, can't find out what personal information is being reported <small>(or stop the reports, even if they do find out)</small>. If it breaks, they can't fix it; they have to wait for the developer to exercise its power to do so. If it simply isn't quite what they need, they are stuck with it. They can't help each other improve it.'"</span><br/>
<br/>
And the recent interview "Three Minutes with Ric<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> <a href="stallman.htm">Stallman</a>" at <a class="ext" href="http://PCWorld.com/article/id,137098-c,freeware/article.html">http://PCWorld.com/article/id,137098-c,freeware/article.html</a> says <span class="quot">"'With <a href="free.htm">free</a> software, the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s are in control. Most of the time, <a href="user.htm">user</a>s want interoperability, and when the software is <a href="free.htm">free</a>, they get what they want. With non-<a href="free.htm">free</a> software, the developer controls the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s. The developer permits interoperability when that suits the developer; what the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s want is beside the point.'"</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a> relies upon initial investing <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers <small>(developers)</small> choosing to retain Copyright so they may apply the constraint: <a href="virt.htm">Virt</a>ual <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es must be made available "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" to any <a href="user.htm">User</a> with whom you share or <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects. This Inter-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>er <a href="trad.htm">Trad</a>e <a href="agree.htm">Agree</a>ment is then perpetually held in place by Instance <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers <small>(anyone <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing a copy of that <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
The physical <a href="real.htm">real</a>m is much <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>, but a variation of these concepts can be applied using regular private <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty law.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public law.htm">General Public Law</a> would similarly rely upon initial investing <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers <small>(often called developers by the way)</small> to choose to add a constraint to any <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect <small>(whether physical or not)</small> of: All <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> <small>(and in fact any a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> paid above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>)</small> must be treated as an investment for that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing customer in more Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es for the future <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of that same kind of <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect so that competition is perfected and democracy becomes direct. Wages are one of those <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s. Wages are not <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>, they are <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment for <a href="work.htm">work</a> as arranged between <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers and potential <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers.<br/>

<a href="user own.htm">User Own</a>ership is a special case in <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omics that has some interesting <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ties:<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Abundance and <a href="real.htm">real</a> solutions are goal and never thought 'destructive'.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Scarcity is not sought and those physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es are <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Un<a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ment is not a problem, it is the s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>d goal.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * <a href="work.htm">Work</a> is to be eliminated as a hurdle on the road to riches.<br/>
<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is meaningless except as consumer growth.<br/>

<br/>
As an example, when you <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of copying an apple, which would you say is better:<br/>
<br/>
1. An arbitrary, non-<a href="work.htm">work</a>ing group of <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers control the care <small>(they may <a href="spray.htm">spray</a> the orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> with dangerous chemicals)</small> of those <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es, and can charge a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> to <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> limited only by other competing <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
2. The <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers are the collective <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers that plant, water, maintain and harvest the fruit. They control the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es similarly to the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers in #1, but at least they can <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> themselves a higher Wage. The consumer still has little control, is not allowed to do any of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> himself, and is still at the mercy of those who <a href="own.htm">Own</a>.<br/>
<br/>
3. The perfect* <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>e where the collective <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers are the Consumers themselves. They can <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e the copies themselves <small>(tend their portion of the orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> in the manner they see fit - and within the constraint of <a href="real.htm">real</a>istic divisibility)</small>, or they may hire others to <a href="work.htm">work</a> for them, but either way we <small>(the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s/consumers)</small> are in complete control. Such a <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>e also causes <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e to be the same as <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>, as <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> has no meaning when the consumer <a href="own.htm">Own</a>s the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es - or in other words, if the Consumer did <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> it, he would be <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing himself.<br/>
<br/>
<small>(*)</small>Option 3 is not achievable in a perfect or <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ic manner <small>(especially during the initial growth period)</small> because the consumer may not yet <a href="own.htm">Own</a> the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es that were <a href="use.htm">use</a>d during the round of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion that created that exact <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect, but this <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>e can always be "approached" by <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers who choose to apply an inter-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er contract that requires any <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> paid by consumers be an investment in more <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, or toward <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing-off some <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent investments, and that that those shares become the semi-divisible <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of that very same consumer."<br/>

It is the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>iculty in organizing large collective investments that keeps <a href="user.htm">User</a>s <small>(Consumers)</small> from <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ing the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion that would allow us to then have "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" access and full control of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects of that <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a is: An initial group of potential <a href="user.htm">User</a>s joint purchase some physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es and voluntarily put that <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty under a contract that requires <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers treat all <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> each <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e be an investment for that new <a href="user.htm">user</a> into <a href="user own.htm">User Own</a>ership of more physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es in that same corporation.<br/>
<br/>
This causes growth to wax and wane according to the demand of those consumers.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * <a href="user.htm">User</a> demand includes covering the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of the last round of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * <a href="user.htm">User</a> demand also contains the desire to grow represented as <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * <a href="user.htm">User</a> lack of demand is the <a href="user.htm">user</a>'s desire to shrink or sell by not <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s.<br/>
