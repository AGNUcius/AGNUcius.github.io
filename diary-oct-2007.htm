<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ut writes:<br/>
Are you saying it didn't help even a little?&nbsp;&nbsp;Gah!<br/>
<br/>
A summary of my response to your other <a href="mail.htm">mail</a> is:<br/>
<br/>
We <small>(any business <a href="own.htm">own</a>er applying the <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment I so often allude to)</small> don't want to hold Consumer_<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e at <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> directly, as <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> measures the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> the Consumer is willing to invest.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of selling the apples "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>", we will sell them at "whatever the market will bear" and <a href="use.htm">use</a> the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> usually designated as <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> to invest for that consumer in <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es to guarantee future <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion incrementally comes under his control through <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the matter of delayed 'handoff' that we might call 'vesting'.<br/>
<br/>
Again, it is important that we charge as high a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e as possible to essentially 'force' the citizen/consumer to invest for their <a href="own.htm">own</a> good.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers never lose <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of anything they want to retain.&nbsp;&nbsp;If they don't want help <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing off their <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent investments, the <a href="new.htm">new</a> consumer investments go toward purchasing more <a href="land.htm">land</a>, trees, water rights, etc., hopefully even nearer to the consumer that paid.<br/>
<br/>
A consumer can receive "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects only *after* they are <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers in direct <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ortion to the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> they consume, and only then because <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> becomes 'undefined' except as their <a href="own.htm">own</a> further investment.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe you meant to say "not <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly practical to INDIVIDUALLY <a href="own.htm">own</a>".&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously it can be practical for SOMEONE to <a href="own.htm">own</a> <small>(re)</small><a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es; you even reference them when you say "we <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> other <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers".&nbsp;&nbsp;I <a href="imag.htm">imag</a>ine you are referring to regular business <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers in that case.<br/>
<br/>
It is practical for a group of inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s to COLLECTIVELY <a href="own.htm">own</a> expensive physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, and it can even be practical for a small business <a href="own.htm">own</a>er to INDIVIDUALLY <a href="own.htm">own</a> expensive physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es as long as those <small>(re)</small><a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es are kept 'busy' across many consumers so the continuous <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership are 'shared' among those consumers.<br/>
<br/>
This is a matter of utilization similar to the scheduling and allocation routines for an OS kernel.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of a <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>al agency or an aerating service can INDIVIDUALLY purchase the expensive physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es: not only the aerator, but also a <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>ding for <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age and maintenance, the <a href="land.htm">land</a> for that <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>ding, a truck and trailer to transport the device, tools, fuel, repair <a href="part.htm">part</a>s, etc. as long as there are enough consumers to cover the initial and re<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ing <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of that <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
The sole <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of a very small business might be the only <a href="work.htm">work</a>er.&nbsp;&nbsp;He may be the operator, mechanic, cashier, advertiser, scheduler all at once.&nbsp;&nbsp;He will <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> himself a wage arbitrarily separated from <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> - probably according to how it effects his taxes.<br/>
<br/>
But when the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is COLLECTIVE, the separation of wage from <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is not so arbitrary.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a <a href="part.htm">part</a>-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er tries to claim too high wage for some <a href="work.htm">work</a> he does, the other <a href="part.htm">part</a>-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers might vote to hire that position to someone who will do it for less.<br/>
<br/>
As the business grows, the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers will hire other non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ing <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers and <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> them wages <a href="calc.htm">calc</a>ulated as another <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
What I have written so far applies to either a <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional "Capitalistic" for-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> corporation or to a "<a href="source freedom.htm">Source Freedom</a>" for-<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t corporation.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence comes in WHO comprises the set called '<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers'.&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is "What is the optimal composition of the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers?", or maybe "WHAT ACTIONS should cause, or to WHOM should <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership 'flow'?".<br/>
<br/>
Once we determine who *should* be the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, we only need write a contract and apply it to some of our <a href="own.htm">own</a> physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es to implement the theory on a small scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are correct, then it will outperform and overgrow standard Capitalism because it will simply be more efficient.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also how the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a>s: inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s <small>(programmers investing time and effort in the case of software)</small> retain just enough <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership <small>(copyright)</small> to enforce the requirement that <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect consumers <small>(<a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect-code <a href="user.htm">user</a>s)</small> gain <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es <small>(a copy of the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e-code)</small> whenever they receive an <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect - whether that <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect was a gift, or if they paid for it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h3">===There are at least 3 choices:</span><br/>
1. It DOESN'T MATTER who <a href="own.htm">own</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is how most <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern corporations are constructed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s commonly have nothing to do this the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, and in many cases <small>(such as with mutual <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s)</small>, small-time inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s may not even <a href="know.htm">know</a> the names of the corporations or what they <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
2. The <a href="work.htm">WORK</a>ERS <a href="own.htm">own</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is common for very small businesses, and is also the solution Karl Marx and many others dream as being optimal to avoid "<a href="work.htm">work</a>er exploitation".<br/>
<br/>
3. The CONSUMERS <a href="own.htm">own</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the pattern that Ric<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> <a href="stallman.htm">Stallman</a> talks about with regard to <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es <small>(non-rivalrous information such as <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e-code or genetics or mechanical design)</small> and is held in place by the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is of course also the goal of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public law.htm">General Public Law</a> meant to be applied to physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es that have or will have more than one <a href="own.htm">own</a>er.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h3">===Consumer <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership Example:</span><br/>
What if you could somehow organize with 100 or so neighbors to jointly purchase an aerator?&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously you would each still need to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> your portion of the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s that a normal aerator business <a href="own.htm">own</a>er would <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <small>(investment, fuel/oil, <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age, upkeep, <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance, etc.)</small> and would also <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> wages <small>(maybe even hiring one of the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers)</small> for <a href="work.htm">work</a> such as maintenance, security guard, and also to an operator if you don't want to or can't run the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp;A portion for some of those <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s <small>(such as some types of wear)</small> will be paid as <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> and will vary according to <small>(be weighted against)</small> the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> you <a href="use.htm">use</a> the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine, while others <small>(such as <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age)</small> will be paid as a periodic tax and will vary according to your percentage of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
Another type of <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> we might call 'exclusion' is strangely similar to <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> in that it is based on high simultaneous demand.&nbsp;&nbsp;This <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> is special because it increases according to the appa<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> need to invest in more of that type of physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;This occurs when <a href="new.htm">new</a> consumers overload the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent availability or when too many consumers want to <a href="use.htm">use</a> the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine at one time instead of being satisfied to wait until a later time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Impatient consumers 'prove' they are willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for another aerator instead of using what is already available at another time <small>(earlier or later in the day or earlier or later in the year)</small> when they drive up the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e by 'bidding' against other potential consumers for a time slot.&nbsp;&nbsp;The winning consumer <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e higher than the total of all other <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s <small>(very similar to what is usually called <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;That 'extra' <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment will be that consumer's investment toward purchasing yet another aerator since it indicates a desire for growth because peak demand is not yet being fulfilled.<br/>
<br/>
When the collective <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect<small>(ive)</small> consumers are also the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <small>(<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> becomes meaningless except as further investment.<br/>
<br/>
I also posted about sharing aerators a couple months ago at <a class="ext" href="http://Blog.P2PFoundation.net/the-call-for-open-social-networks-is-getting-louder-and-louder/2007/09/07">Blog.P2PFoundation.net/the-call-for-open-social-networks-is-getting-louder-and-louder/2007/09/07</a><br/>
<br/>
Here is a relevant excerpt:<br/>
When <a href="user.htm">user</a>s <small>(consumers)</small> <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> a <a href="pric.htm">PRIC</a>E for some good or service, they are <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing for the <a href="cost.htm">COST</a>S of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion that the capital <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers in<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ed for that round of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, and those <a href="user.htm">user</a>s usually also <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> an a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> above <a href="cost.htm">COST</a>S which is <small>(in a simplified manner)</small> generally <a href="calc.htm">calc</a>ulated as <a href="profit.htm">PROFIT</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">PROFIT</a> is therefore the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between Consumer_<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e and <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s, and is a rough measure of incomplete monopoly. In other words, <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is an inverse measure of competition, and is ‘balanced’ or even eliminated when it becomes an investment for the <a href="user.htm">User</a> that just paid it.<br/>
<br/>
I will quote myself to fix a typo and to begin an example as Michel suggested to try to prove that it is the Consumers and NOT the <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers that must be the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers of physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es for us to approach a perfected <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy:<br/>
<br/>
"<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ing expensive capital with a group of other <a href="user.htm">user</a>s is valuable even when none of you can operate it because you can always hire that <a href="work.htm">work</a> done - and would treat those wages as a <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of operation, but could never <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> unless you were to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> it to yourselves."<br/>
<br/>
Let’s say a <a href="work.htm">work</a>er comes to your door asking to aerate your lawn. Aerators are generally too expensive to <a href="own.htm">own</a> for just one lawn, but you need the <a href="job.htm">job</a> done, so you <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the <a href="pric.htm">PRIC</a>E of $30.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="pric.htm">PRIC</a>E includes the <a href="cost.htm">COST</a>S of:<br/>
&nbsp; Investment: If the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er has not yet <a href="recover.htm">recover</a>ed the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e he paid for the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine.<br/>
&nbsp; Maintenance: Wear, Oil, Fuel<br/>
&nbsp; Wages: Whatever the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er and <a href="own.htm">own</a>er negotiate.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="pric.htm">PRIC</a>E also includes <a href="profit.htm">PROFIT</a> for the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er that instantly increases the moment the capital has been “paid off”.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if you and a bunch of your neighbors got together to buy your <a href="own.htm">OWN</a> aerator, you would still have all the same <a href="cost.htm">COST</a>S as mentioned above which could be covered by each of you <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ing the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine from the collective others, but <a href="profit.htm">PROFIT</a> would have no meaning, as <a href="pric.htm">PRIC</a>E and <a href="cost.htm">COST</a>S would be <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>ntical.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, when the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine was finally “paid off”, the <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>al <a href="pric.htm">PRIC</a>E would fall even further, as that <a href="cost.htm">COST</a> would be eliminated.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot2">>> Will we always step on the undeveloped instead of heeding their cry for</span><br/>
<span class="quot2">>> growth?&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you not see that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> *REQUIRES* poverty, and the</span><br/>

<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> I can see that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is a form of loss for the consumer, but I don't</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> understand why you say this "requires" poverty.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you explain this?</span><br/>
<br/>
Poverty is a continum that most everyone <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipates in.&nbsp;&nbsp;Extreme poverty means you cannot meet even your most basic needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;While some humans are incapable of fending for themselves, or have given up because of past attempts and failures in a system designed to keep them oppressed, I am not addressing those case at this time.&nbsp;&nbsp;The poverty I am referring to is the low "standard of <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>ing" or poor "quality of life" had by so many of the very <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>est <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
Poverty is held in place 'naturally' when <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects are truly scarce <small>(there aren't enough coconuts to feed everyone on the is<a href="land.htm">land</a>, even if we share nicely)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
But for-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers also hold poverty in place '<a href="art.htm">art</a>ificially' in two ways: initially by keeping <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects too expensive <small>(<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers hold <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> without treating that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as consumer investment in more <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es)</small> and finally by holding <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificially scarce in that <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> wages lower than what consumers would <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> those same <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers or the consumers would rather do the <a href="work.htm">work</a> themselves but are not allowed <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e access.<br/>
<br/>
So <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> requires poverty through high <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es and low wages:<br/>
1. <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> depends upon keeping <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a consumer <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> that is treated as physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e investment, he approaches "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" access to the output or <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects of those <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es: food/drugs, housing, cloth, <a href="soap.htm">soap</a>, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;The potential to <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> against a consumer is lost as that consumer crawls out of poverty when gaining <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership because an <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect consumer who <a href="own.htm">own</a>s the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of those <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects will only <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>, and since <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is defined as "<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>", <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> relies upon poverty at the point-of-sale BY DEFINITION.<br/>
<br/>
2. <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> also somewhat depends upon keeping wages lower than the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er deserves by <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing the separation from <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> from what the consumer would <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e <small>(the consumer <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s both <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> and wage either way, the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence is in the separation)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The more physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es a consumer collectively <a href="own.htm">own</a>s, the less they need to worry about <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing for another because they can just <a href="work.htm">work</a> for themselves for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, and hence can demand higher wages when <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing for others <small>(all <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers are also consumers)</small>.<br/>

That reminds me of the "greedy" search algorithm we learned about in CS and how it is sometime sub-optimal.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also related to the Nash Equilibrium or the Prisoner’s Dilemma - where an individual may choose a <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>off that is not the best for the group, but is better than the worst for himself; maybe out of fear or because there wasn’t a prior arrangement that could have ensured the other <a href="part.htm">part</a>y would also be bound to choose the best alternative.<br/>

<span class="quot">> to focus those principles, somehow, on mortgages, and <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance.</span><br/>
<br/>
Addressing mortgages is especially <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult <small>(but not impossible)</small>, as it will require us to purchase some <a href="land.htm">land</a> outside of a city and <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e a completely <a href="new.htm">new</a> city with the local tax <small>(<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>)</small> system weighted against exclusion and other <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s instead weighting against improvements.<br/>
<br/>
Addressing <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance is an integral <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public law.htm">General Public Law</a> and can be understood as physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership being a hedge against future calamity.&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, you can <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e your car by having <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in a repair shop and in supporting the education and wages of mechanics for that shop.&nbsp;&nbsp;Health <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance is had by <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing controlling shares in a hospital and in supporting the education and wages for doctors and nurses and also by investing in pharmaceutical research <small>(done whenever you <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> more than <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> for drugs)</small> and procedural research <small>(done whenever you <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> more than <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> for procedures)</small>, etc.<br/>

Applying <a href="source freedom.htm">Source Freedom</a> through the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public law.htm">General Public Law</a> to an <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect and the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of that <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect is not <a href="imag.htm">imag</a>inary, it is <a href="real.htm">real</a>istic and legal in the same way that applying the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a> to "<a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code" and the <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es <small>("<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code")</small> is accomplished: it only occurs when private <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers choose to apply it to their <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>icense is only applicable to non-rivalrous, copyrightable information or in other words '<a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual' <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects such as software, DNA <small>(genetics)</small>, mechanical design, music, video, etc.<br/>
<br/>
But <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>aw is applied to pure information such as software, genetics or mechanical design AND to the rivalrous physical <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects such as the DVD, apple or an aerator that are required to 'host' that information.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>icense requires the <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es <small>(<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code)</small> be made available "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" to any <a href="user.htm">user</a> that receives a copy of a <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect <small>(executable)</small> whether the <a href="user.htm">user</a> <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s a fee for the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect or not.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>aw governs the <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of any <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect with the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>icense, and ALSO requires the <a href="user.htm">user</a> <small>(consumer)</small> gain <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es by treating any <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> as an investment from the <a href="user.htm">user</a> that paid it.<br/>
<br/>
So let's say I <a href="start.htm">start</a> a <a href="source freedom.htm">Source Freedom</a> business/community center in which I voluntarily place all the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects and their physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es under the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public law.htm">General Public Law</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some of the transactions that might occur there:<br/>
<br/>
1. Sell consumable physical <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects such as: apples, almonds, honey...<br/>
2. <a href="rent.htm">Rent</a> durable physical <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects such as: aerator, floor <a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e, grill/oven, mini theater, <a href="pop.htm">pop</a>corn <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine, car/truck...<br/>
3. Hire <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>ed <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers such as cooks, cashiers, shelf <a href="stock.htm">stock</a>ers, orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> tending...<br/>
4. Enable <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>ed <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers to offer their services directly to other customers.<br/>
<br/>
None of this is charity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything would be either sold or <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ed at the highest <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e the consumer is willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;A consumer <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing more than <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> is simply communicating that they need <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of that <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect<small>[ive]</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> Follow my train of</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> thought here and you'll see why this is all so confusing to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> understand that it would be a good thing for a consumer to only <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion for the goods and services that they consume.</span><br/>
<br/>
I <a href="use.htm">use</a> the term "<a href="own.htm">Own</a>er <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>" or sometimes just "<a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" to represent what you call here the "<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion".<br/>
<br/>
I do not suggest we <small>(anyone selling a <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect or service)</small> should <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificially hold the "Consumer <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e" down at the "<a href="own.htm">Own</a>er <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>".&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact it is important that we DON'T do this, and that we charge what the "market will bear" since the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e and <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <small>(what is usually called '<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>')</small> is a good measure of how much the consumer is in need of investment, so should be gathered from them for the purpose of growth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> I also</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> understand that it would be nice if <small>(somehow)</small> any excess the consumer <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> beyond <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> went into increased <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the means of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <small>(or</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> did I get that wrong?)</small>.</span><br/>
<br/>
Yes, that is right.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to say <small>(somehow)</small>, as it can be done by any <a href="own.htm">own</a>er that is willing to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are such things as Not-For-<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> corporations right?&nbsp;&nbsp;They don't *require* <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> to exist, in fact the excess <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y is sometimes a bit of a problem for them.<br/>
<br/>
What I am talking about is similar except we simply stipulate at the time the corporation forms that the destination of those <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s will be an investment for the consumer that paid them.<br/>
<br/>
There are some details about the "increased <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership" that can be confusing: <a href="curr.htm">Curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers are never in danger of losing control that they do not offer up for investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;If an <a href="own.htm">own</a>er wants to keep full control of an orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a>, then the <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> <small>(consumer investment)</small> would target <a href="new.htm">NEW</a> <a href="land.htm">land</a>, trees, tools, etc. - hopefully in a location even closer to the consumer's home.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> Now, I don't have an apple tree <small>(or, do I?&nbsp;&nbsp;are</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> all assets <a href="part.htm">part</a>ially <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by everyone?)</small>,</span><br/>
<br/>
Again, this is not an <a href="imag.htm">imag</a>inary situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand <small>(just as Ric<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> <a href="stallman.htm">Stallman</a> understood)</small> that <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent laws cannot be changed from the top down because we simply don't have the <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s to purchase those changes <small>(to be as cynical as we must in order to fully understand the kettle we are in)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> utilizes the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent legal system <small>(copyright in the case of <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, and private <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty law in the case of physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es)</small> to help private <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers to ADD the constraints needed to keep the Nash Equilibrium in place.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> so I go and buy my apple from a</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> Joe <small>(a <a href="source freedom.htm">source freedom</a> <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipant)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that it's going to be</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> enormously <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult for Joe to tell me the at-<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e right there at</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> that moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;He may, at the end of the season, be able to determine the</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> total <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of operating his orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> and divide it all up to figure out</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> what he should have charged me, and what <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s, if any, he made by</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> overcharging me, or losses he made by undercharging me, but I think it'd</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> be rather <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult for Joe to tell me the at-<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e immediately.</span><br/>
<br/>
Again, Joe would charge you as much as possible which would likely be above operation <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s since you are not yet an <a href="own.htm">own</a>er, so have few alternatives.<br/>
<br/>
But to address the other <a href="part.htm">part</a> of this question, I think Joe *could* determine the operation <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s at any moment by examining the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s over the previous 364 days plus today instead of arbitrarily breaking the year at January 1st.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> Now, also, <a href="imag.htm">imag</a>ine Joe has only one tree and there are many people asking</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> for apples from Joe.&nbsp;&nbsp;How does this scarcity <small>(the re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of Earth are</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> not infinite)</small> affect the at-<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e?&nbsp;&nbsp;You see, I'm already stuck.</span><br/>
<br/>
Joe will charge a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e *above* <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> whenever he can.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="real.htm">Real</a> scarcity is the natural reason consumers should be investing.&nbsp;&nbsp;The "<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" <small>(what is usually called <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> that those consumers <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> will become their investments in yet more <a href="land.htm">land</a> and trees and water rights so competition is perfected <small>(though never quite perfect because of the dynamic nature of consumers)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This causes growth to wax and wane according to consumer demand as it should and distributes control among those that deserve it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> I can't even begin to purchase this apple because Joe can't charge me as</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> he doesn't <a href="know.htm">know</a> the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e.</span><br/>
<br/>
Joe will set "Consumer <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e" at whatever the "market will bear", or in other words, Joe will simply be competing with other growers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let's also say that Joe is less <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>ed than</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> his friend Frank, who also grows apples.&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank's <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> is less than Joe's</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> because Frank <a href="know.htm">know</a>s what he's doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Should Joe and Frank both sell their</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> apples at their <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>?</span><br/>
<br/>
They will each sell at whatever the "market will bear", which will be "<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" for as long as <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect consumers are not yet <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers in direct <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ortion to the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> they consume.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> If so, maybe Joe's apples will go bad because</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> he's forced to not lower his <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e in order to compete with Frank, and so</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> everyone goes to buy apples from Frank.&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, Frank knew how to</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> thin his trees and his apples are of much higher quality than Joe's, and</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> still took less re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e than Joe's.&nbsp;&nbsp;Must Joe still sell</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> at-<a href="cost.htm">cost</a>?</span><br/>
<br/>
Frank's higher quality may allow a higher "Consumer <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e", and his lower <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s will also mean there is more <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> <small>(remember, wages are a <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>)</small>, so his orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> will cause more growth than Joe's.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a GOOD thing, since we want <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>ed <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers to succeed in their field and un<a href="skill.htm">skill</a>ed to fail so they move to profession where they fit.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably, or else he will lose <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y.&nbsp;&nbsp;Must Frank sell at-<a href="cost.htm">cost</a></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> if doing so will harm Joe <small>(as no one will buy Joe's apples in preference</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> to Frank's)</small>?</span><br/>
<br/>
The better <a href="work.htm">work</a>er should 'win' for the benefit of the community as a whole.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> And I still haven't purchased the apple.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let's say</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> somehow that these <small>(and I'm sure there are other)</small> issues are all magically</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> resolved and somehow I purchase an apple from Joe at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Great!</span><br/>
<br/>
Again, you will most likely purchase at a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> However, let's say that at the end of the season Joe discovers that I</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> overpaid him <small>(I won't even bother going off on the <a href="thread.htm">thread</a> where I</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> underpaid him)</small>, how does Joe factor this miniscule overpayment into future</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> purchases that I <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e from him?&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly what type of <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>tation is</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> performed by Joe during the next season when I purchase an apple from him?</span><br/>
<br/>
That overpayment is your investment in more physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es such as <a href="land.htm">land</a>, trees, water rights and tools - or toward <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing off some of Joe's investments if he is offering them up for sale.&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision is initially up to Joe, but there needs to be some kind of delayed 'vesting' or "hand off" that I still don't <a href="know.htm">know</a> the details.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully you can help with this 'bug'.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I now a <a href="part.htm">part</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>er in Joe's orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a>?</span><br/>
<br/>
Joe may have been applying your investments to an <a href="new.htm">new</a> orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> far from the one that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed your apples, or may have applied it toward <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing off some of his previous investments.<br/>
<br/>
If Joe applied those <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s into <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing off some of his <a href="own.htm">own</a> trees, then there comes the complication of access:<br/>
<br/>
1. Either he must be also incrementally selling you the <a href="land.htm">land</a> under those trees and guaranteeing "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" access to them,<br/>
2. Or he must be guaranteeing "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" or "<a href="pass.htm">pass</a> through" <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s for your <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>al of those parcels for a time reasonably coincident to the life of that tree.<br/>
3. There are other probably other issues/bugs that need to be exposed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> If so, how do I <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> my</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> "investment" if Joe decides to burn down his rotten trees because they</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> just don't measure up to Frank's?</span><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Most <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> that sugar and drugs <small>(two of Lessig's examples)</small> are <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful when <a href="use.htm">use</a>d with care.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course we need <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts, but some groups <small>(corporations)</small> want to trick the rest of us into consuming more than we <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly need.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is bad for our health, our environment and our personal finances.<br/>
<br/>
This <a href="art.htm">art</a>ifical pressure to consume is not <a href="part.htm">part</a> of all groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;When people are truly cooperating they want just the opposite; they want each to consume as little as possible so there is enough for the others and so there is generally less <a href="work.htm">work</a> to be done.&nbsp;&nbsp;But when we are not cooperating, this goal is INVERTED by the '<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers' who are seeking a prize beyond the immediate results of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
Uncooperative <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers also seek to increase scarcity and dependence.&nbsp;&nbsp;How could we have gotten these <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>amental goals <a href="back.htm">back</a>ward?&nbsp;&nbsp;Where or how do we go astray from our original goals of abundance and <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom?<br/>
<br/>
<a href="part.htm">Part</a> of the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>iculty in understanding the problem is the number of variables and overwhelming complexity of a large <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern society.&nbsp;&nbsp;But <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic truths are continuous.&nbsp;&nbsp;We should be able to begin with the minimal case of a small set of isolated humans trying to cooperate for their <a href="own.htm">own</a> sake and slowly scale it up until we see where it 'breaks'.<br/>
<br/>
So let's say a small group of people is interested in <a href="start.htm">start</a>ing an independent community <small>(whether a commune or maybe some stranded is<a href="land.htm">land</a>ers or even some planet pioneers)</small> intending to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e their <a href="own.htm">own</a> food, housing, clothing, sugar, drugs, etc..&nbsp;&nbsp;It is almost certain that most of those individuals will want to <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e some of their <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s with some of the others because of the increased efficiency that specialization brings.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Such a small group may have little or no <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between the rules of governance for their '<a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>e' and the management decisions for the 'Corporate' activity because they are all "on the same side".&nbsp;&nbsp;This could be thought of as a type of Corporatism <small>(the mixture of corporation and <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e)</small> that is natural and good.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is right, government and business are naturally and safely COMBINED under certain conditions that usually appear when the group is very small and isolated because the goals are the same.<br/>
<br/>
Capitalism tends to assume consumer goals as asserted by and <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>er goals must be SEPARATE and at odds with one another.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>e-run Communism tries to rectify this by keeping business and government COMBINED but under centralized control.<br/>
<br/>
Another <small>(for now unnamed)</small> approach keeps business and government COMBINED by assuming all collective <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership will act as a public utility for that good or service by <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ing each consumer gains<br/>
<br/>

But none of that explains WHY groups do this, only that they do.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, forget it, I'll just tell you what is too blasphemous for anyone else to say:<br/>
<br/>
The only reason the goals of these groups are inverted from abundance and <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom toward scarcity and oppression is because <a href="profit.htm">PROFIT</a> is being misunderstood as a prize to be won against those that are not already developed, instead of being treated as an investment <small>(in more <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es)</small> from the consumer that just paid it.<br/>
<br/>
When <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> <small>(the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect_Consumer_<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e and <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e_<a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s)</small> is thought to be value added by <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers that receive it are incented to <a href="work.htm">work</a> against the consumer in a variety of ways, including the over<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of sugar for the sake of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> itself, while the original goal of <a href="produc.htm">PRODUC</a>T is forgotten.<br/>
<br/>
When the consumer of an <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect <small>(say an apple)</small> is also the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">own</a>er <small>(of the <a href="land.htm">land</a>, tree and water rights)</small>, there is no reason to worry if your neighbor is growing apples, and you don't try to overconsume, as your goal is <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, not <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
But when an <a href="own.htm">own</a>er begins selling <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects to non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ing consumers, the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> they charge above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s <small>(wages being one of those <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s)</small> is an indication of that consumer's DEPENDENCE <small>(remember Lessig's <a href="use.htm">use</a> of this word)</small> on that <a href="own.htm">own</a>er. That <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence <small>(usually called <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> should be considered an INVESTMENT from that consumer. By doing this, competition is maximized <small>(every consumer becomes a <a href="part.htm">part</a>ial <a href="own.htm">own</a>er)</small> and <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is indirectly eliminated <small>(you can't meaningfully charge more than <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> to yourself unless you are investing in more trees)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Treating <a href="own.htm">own</a>er <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as consumer investment also distributes control at each transaction so governance becomes decentralized and non-representational. Once this is in place, business and government can be recombined, as their goals will be <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>ntical!<br/>
<br/>
That's right, it creates a valid and <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful form of Corporatism <small>(the mixture of corporation and <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e)</small> because there is no longer a conflict of interests when <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is understood to be a consumer's plea for growth, and is treated as such.<br/>

I thought you might mean that. The conundrum has already been cracked by many. While I like discussion as much as the next guy, there is a wealth of information out there. I think <a href="part.htm">Part</a> 1 of Capitalism 3.0 by Peter Barnes is a good brief primer on the problem: <a class="ext" href="http://capitalism3.com/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf">http://capitalism3.com/files/Capitalism_3.0_Peter_Barnes.pdf</a><br/>
<br/>
Further investigation will take you to <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists such as Joe Stiglitz and the role of information asymmetry.<br/>
<br/>
In short, there is a systemic problem, to quote the quote of a quote:<br/>
<br/>
In the <a href="art.htm">art</a>icle "Summary: What P2P Means for the World of Tomorrow" <small>[2007]</small> Michel Bauwens delineates the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent counter<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive logic of social organisation:<br/>

<br/>
b)</small> it is based on a false concept of scarcity in the infinite immaterial world; instead of allowing continuous experimental social innovation, it purposely erects legal and technical barriers to disallow <a href="free.htm">free</a> cooperation through copyright, patents, etcetera<br/>
<br/>
I hope these materials help you dig deeper. You may find it helpful to turn your question on its head: how could a system <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>t on these false concepts act toward the best interests of a cooperative community?<br/>

By "inverted drive" I was asking why the goals of so many corporations are in dis<a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment with the rest of humanity; I wasn't calling Lessig's efforts inverted.<br/>
<br/>
Lessig's goals are fine at the level they question, but I would like to go deeper.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of accepting a-priori that ALL corporations <small>(groups of people)</small> must ALWAYS act against society, I'm asking WHY corporate goals tend to be inverted from those of a cooperative community, especially as that corporation grows.<br/>
<br/>
This may seem too stupid a question, but the FULL answer continues to elude my ability to put it in words.<br/>
<br/>
Whoever is reading this, please write a little - even if just a few words that come to your mind - almost as a Rorschach Test so we can <a href="collab.htm">collab</a>oratively crack this conundrum.<br/>

Unless you assume that the <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e and public authorities will disappear tommorow, struggling to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e them more accountable to civil society, rather than to the corporations, continues to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e sense. This does not preclude a continued effort for a more autonomous civil society and peer governance, but transgressive behaviour alone is not enough, if it is not combined by a judicious combination of constructive <a href="new.htm">new</a>-world creation and engagement for changing the existing institutional base.<br/>

We seem to accept that all corporations will act against society, and then want our 'leaders' to stop them "at the gate".<br/>
<br/>
I would like to take a step <a href="back.htm">back</a> and ask:<br/>
<br/>
Why do corporations, especially as they succeed, tend to take courses that do not serve the consumer <small>(citizen)</small>?<br/>
<br/>
Is it impossible to construct an organization <small>(whether corporate or governmental)</small> that continues to serve only the consumers <small>(citizens)</small>, even as it grows?<br/>
<br/>
Why do small groups <small>(say on a deserted is<a href="land.htm">land</a>)</small> not attack each other in such blatant ways? What changes as the number of humans increases?<br/>
<br/>
If some humans collectively purchased some <a href="land.htm">land</a> and capital <small>(<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion)</small> dedicated to being a true utility for the public, what would they need to do <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ly to <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e the cooperation would continue?<br/>

<span class="quot2">>> My goals?</span><br/>
<span class="quot2">>></span><br/>
<span class="quot2">>> Well, I have this crazy fantasy of being extremely self sufficient.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd like to <a href="own.htm">own</a> a small homestead <small>(somewhere around 5-20 acres)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Stuff I'd like to be able to do with the homestead:</span><br/>
<span class="quot2">>></span><br/>
<span class="quot2">>> 1)</small> Have enough <a href="land.htm">land</a> <small>(paid off, no mortgage)</small> for <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>e<a href="stock.htm">stock</a>: chickens, cow, pigs, goats, horses, geese, ducks, turkey, etc.</span><br/>
<span class="quot2">>> 2)</small> Have <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful timber on my <a href="land.htm">land</a> <small>(I'm thinking of Oregon's Willamette valley - good climate and lots of trees there)</small> - <a href="use.htm">use</a> portable sawmill to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e my <a href="own.htm">own</a> lumber - <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d my <a href="own.htm">own</a> structures with my <a href="own.htm">own</a> materials</span><br/>
<span class="quot2">>> 3)</small> Be off the grid, using a hybrid power solution <small>(solar, wind, hydro)</small> as well as <a href="pass.htm">pass</a>ive solar design</span><br/>
<span class="quot2">>> 4)</small> Have water rights to sufficient clean water for drinking, cleaning, irrigation, etc.</span><br/>
<span class="quot2">>> 5)</small> Grow 70+% of the food my family consumes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Garden, Orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a>, Greenhouse, Fish Pond.&nbsp;&nbsp;Canning and preserving.</span><br/>
<span class="quot2">>></span><br/>
<span class="quot2">>> The two biggest hurdles to accomplishing this are:</span><br/>
<span class="quot2">>></span><br/>
<span class="quot2">>> 1)</small> Getting the <a href="land.htm">land</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This one's the kicker, 'cause good <a href="land.htm">land</a> is not cheap.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it's very likely that <a href="stor.htm">Stor</a>ageCraft will be acquired within the next two years.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that my share , after the acquisition, will be sufficient to finance this.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I'm <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly hoping to get the ball rolling on all this within two years.</span><br/>
<span class="quot2">>> 2)</small> Convincing Heather that we can be happy when we're more than 15 minutes from a Target.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's going to be a <a href="real.htm">real</a> challenge to move my family out to a rural setting.&nbsp;&nbsp;The further away from urban life, the <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>er it will be to convince her.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm pretty sure that in order for me to actually accomplish these goals I'm going to have to develop the homestead as a vacation <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty initially - develop it slowly and not <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>e there full time <small>(which may <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e it VERY <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult to develop)</small> and only move there permanently after it's well established and/or Heather wants to move to the homestead.&nbsp;&nbsp;She's convinced that our kids would hate it, but I believe that as long as we had good neighbors it wouldn't matter if our kids had to walk for 5 minutes to get to their house, they would still have friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm also pretty sure that they'd enjoy that life style.</span><br/>
<span class="quot2">>></span><br/>
<span class="quot2">>> Hey, are you <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing now, or have you somehow figured out a way to not <a href="work.htm">work</a> anymore?</span><br/>
<span class="quot2">>></span><br/>
<span class="quot2">>></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> ----</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> Ah yes, there are many who desire to begin the homestead to break <a href="free.htm">free</a> from the 'system'.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> I am tempted to talk about how the Security and Prosperity <a href="part.htm">Part</a>nership and the NASCO Corridor will be increasing the privatization <small>(<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>eering)</small> of our water supply to the point of bringing us all into subjection under an international rule that we can only fight by banding together, but will restrain myself.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> Instead, tell me more about your goals:</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> When trying to develop an area as you describe, of course you won't *actually* be doing *everything* yourself, since you will simply purchase many things that are far too <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e for yourself in any reasonable a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of time considering the limitations of your finances <small>(such as the sawmill)</small>.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> This means that you are admitting that specialization <small>(division of labor)</small> is a <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful thing, and yet you <small>(and many others)</small> are "running away" from society in an attempt to self-sustain.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> I fully understand the reason people do this is because the 'system' is truly failing to meet our needs.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> But if you were stranded on an is<a href="land.htm">land</a> with a dozen college girls, wouldn't it be better to <a href="work.htm">work</a> WITH them instead of striking out on your <a href="own.htm">own</a> - so they could cook and sew while you hunted and harvested?</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> What IS IT about sharing re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es that tends to eventually lead a society to fail the very <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipants it was organized to help?</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> Is it some size limit that we must stay under?&nbsp;&nbsp;If so, is it de<a href="note.htm">note</a>d by a number?</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> Is it that we MUST be solitary for success?&nbsp;&nbsp;Wouldn't it be easier to finance and then share a sawmill between some other homesteaders by having each of you <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> it from the collective others when using it <small>(to cover the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of wear)</small>?</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> What is the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between sharing some <a href="land.htm">land</a> or capital in that manner and the collective holdings of a small city government?</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> Using this point of view, what is the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between tax and <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>?</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot2">>> Nah, dude, I'm not trying to run away from society.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no problem with division of labor.&nbsp;&nbsp;Specialization is a good thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;But just because specialization is a good thing I don't think this means that you'll have the richest, most satisfying life, if each individual spends 100% of their time only doing the thing<small>(s)</small> at which they're most specialized.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> Good point.&nbsp;&nbsp;Interacting with nature is beneficial for reasons I didn't mention.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot2">>> I want to have a homestead because I just feel that there's no need for me to buy apples from the <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>e when I can just grow them on a tree myself. No need to buy eggs when I can have chickens.&nbsp;&nbsp;Etc, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;There's a lot that I can do on my <a href="own.htm">own</a> just fine without being an absolute specialist in those areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet I intend to continue to <a href="work.htm">work</a> at my <a href="own.htm">own</a> specialty as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;I intend to selectively rely on the results of society's specialized services.</span><br/>
<span class="quot2">>></span><br/>
<span class="quot2">>> Truly abandoning society would mean giving up on all of the goods and services that society offers, as well as fellowship, and that'd be an incredibly inefficient, lonesome, poor life, IMHO.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've no intent to do this.&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess I'm saying that I think that I can be more self sufficient by being more selective about the things upon which I'm dependent.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to maximize the return for my efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I grow an apple, I get the whole apple.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I buy an apple, I expend more than an apple's worth of labor to get it, generally.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> Yes!&nbsp;&nbsp;This is tremendously important!&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not pursue it now, as I am tempted to, but I am very happy you recognize this.&nbsp;&nbsp;If your <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ement were not true, then we could eat every meal at a restaurant <small>(in fact it would be cheaper)</small> since SOMEONE has to do the <a href="work.htm">work</a>, so why not allow a specialist?</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot2">>> I want to <a href="work.htm">work</a> with the college girls, when it <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es sense, and when it will maximize the return on my <a href="own.htm">own</a> labor.</span><br/>
<span class="quot2">>> Damn!&nbsp;&nbsp;If I was stranded on an is<a href="land.htm">land</a> with a dozen college girls... LOL... you kill me.&nbsp;&nbsp;That'd be horomonal Nirvana, of course.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> Just threw that in to keep you reading.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot2">>></span><br/>
<span class="quot2">>> Sure it <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es sense to share re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll most likely <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> the sawmill rather than buy my <a href="own.htm">own</a>.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> But of course you will be <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing much more than <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> if you <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> from a <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>eer instead of from a collective group of other <a href="user.htm">user</a>s.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot2">>></span><br/>
<span class="quot2">>> Tax is <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>, isn't it?</span><br/>
<span class="quot2">>></span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> Yes, except tax is generally weighted against your <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tivity <small>(improve your lot and your <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty taxes go up, put a car on blocks in the front yard and they fall.&nbsp;&nbsp;Same with income tax: the more you <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e, the more you are punished.)</small>, and is not collected for the direct <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment of the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s <small>(including exclusion of others)</small> to cover the re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e in question, but is instead put into a slush-<a href="fund.htm">fund</a> that can be drawn from in whatever way the corporate directed representatives see fit.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot2">>> Are you a <a href="land.htm">land</a> baron now?&nbsp;&nbsp;How is it that you can survive without <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing full-time?&nbsp;&nbsp;If you feel that's none of my business, just ignore this question.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm just curious.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> Sorry for skipping that question.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently receiving Federal Reserve <a href="note.htm">Note</a>s from an <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>er.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> I recently turned my 401k into an IRA and have drawn a bit from there, but will need to get something going within 6 months or so.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> The ~3 acres behind my house is not as in demand as a few years <a href="back.htm">back</a> because the housing market is getting soft <small>(wages are not keeping pace with inflation)</small>, so I'm not sure we will be able to sell it for a '<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>'.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> Cindy and I would both like to get out of here, but are not sure where to go.&nbsp;&nbsp;She claims to want to <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>e in a commune, but hates talking to me about any of the details because she thinks everything I say is too abstract.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> I've been thinking lately I should <a href="start.htm">start</a> a <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>al business that is also an internet cafe, <a href="game.htm">game</a>room, <a href="work.htm">work</a>shop, mini-theater, s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>d-hand buy/sell <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>e, etc. and place that <a href="land.htm">land</a>, <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>ding and tools under a contract as I have described in the past so the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s incrementally become <a href="real.htm">real</a> voting shareholders whenever they <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> any a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> over <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> The reason I haven't <small>(and probably won't)</small> <a href="start.htm">start</a> such a thing is because I can't get anyone to understand this enough to help me <a href="work.htm">work</a> out the rest of the bugs, and I am very poor at public relations <small>(being a "highly expressed" INTP)</small>, so would likely fail unless I could get some more charismatic humans to organize some of it and to <a href="work.htm">work</a> the front-line.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot2">>> What type of commune is Cindy interested in, exactly?&nbsp;&nbsp;And, more</span><br/>
<span class="quot2">>> importantly, would there be lots of lonely college girls there?</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> I asked Cindy and she said "one in which I can keep my finances separate".</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> Later she alluded to an <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a that I think she called "Dual Communes"</span><br/>
