My <a href="work.htm">work</a> is mostly centered around what I have recently been calling "Transaction-Reduced <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion" which shows most <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e in the marketplace is an unnecessary side-effect of <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership being not yet distributed, and how the need for <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e is greatly reduced as that distribution approaches 'perfect'.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a is for group members to <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e *commitments* of labor and <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es *before* <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion begins, and thereby avoid most external <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y by instead <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing in 'receipts' which were issued by the group to each member according to the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> the did commit.<br/>
<br/>
This <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es barter more <a href="real.htm">real</a>istic because "simultaneous coincidence of wants" can be iteratively resolved over a period of negotiations instead of being a <a href="real.htm">real</a>-time immediate problem.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am also <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing on a better way to explain how/why the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es is the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects even before they are <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed.<br/>
<br/>
I will show the exchange of goods is an indication of <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty mis-alignment, and how treating <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er investment is a negative-feed<a href="back.htm">back</a> loop which removes that activity.<br/>
<br/>
For the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of an Almond tree <small>(a <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e)</small> is also the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of the Almonds <small>(the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects)</small> even before they have blossomed - even if he must hire or <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e with someone else to get the <a href="work.htm">work</a> done.<br/>
<br/>
So when the <a href="user.htm">user</a> of an <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect <small>(say an Almond)</small> is the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <small>(an Almond tree)</small>, he must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s, including wages, but does not <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, for he does not buy those <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects but <a href="own.htm">own</a>s them already.<br/>

<br/>
I wish it were the same so we could avoid the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>iculty of re-thinking.<br/>
<br/>
Cooperatives operate very <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ly from <a href="imput.htm">Imput</a>ed <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion mostly because the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s do not have <a href="real.htm">real</a>, divisible <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
This lack of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is obvious when you look at the <br/>
<br/>
Consider a small group that <a href="own.htm">own</a>s a small dairy.<br/>
<br/>
You'll need to keep the sizes small during this mental exercise because we have been programmed to believe larger groups *MUST* be governed in a representative manner even though that is not true.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine the number of members just 2 people if you must.<br/>
<br/>
Now, when the milk is taken from the cattle and <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>ed in the refrigerator, *who* is the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t?<br/>
<br/>
Will each of the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers be required to *buy* the milk from the collective as a whole, or will they just split it up according to how much <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership they each have in the dairy?<br/>
<br/>
If there were just two people, will they each be required to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> into some strange pool that they will then <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> themselves again?<br/>
<br/>
Does this change at 3 people?&nbsp;&nbsp;4, 5, 10, 20, 100, 1000?<br/>
<br/>
In a Cooperative: <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>s are re-distributed to members.<br/>
<a href="imput.htm">Imput</a>ed <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion: <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>s are *undefined* because the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t is never sold.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is *undefined* when Consumers <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es directly.<br/>
<br/>
But in a Consumer Cooperative, the organization itself *sells* the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t <a href="back.htm">back</a> to the Consumer-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers, and in doing so 'earns' <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;even though that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers should already be the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers]</small>, and in doing so, that faceless organization collects <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> and therefore concentrates power into a committee which then has no choice but to inflict "Tyranny of the Majority" upon all those who <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is a result of a poor arrangement where the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers have to buy the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t <a href="back.htm">back</a> from themselves!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Even more astounding, when a <a href="work.htm">work</a>er <small>(human)</small> has sufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of that which he consumes, then the 'problems' of abundance and automation disappear.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no longer a reason to throttle <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion or destroy <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t or be afraid of innovation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Those extra transactions are also targets for the containing governments to punish them with sales tax and open them to scrutiny as to whether they should be allowed to sell something as dangerous as raw milk, whereas what I describe side-steps these issues altogether.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Hello Suresh,<br/>
<br/>
I write to you personally instead of to the OpenKollab list because I<br/>
have a <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>osal that I am not sure is welcome, but is definitely<br/>
relevant.<br/>
<br/>
I am a senior <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter programmer with a degree in <a href="compu.htm">Compu</a>ter Science.<br/>
I point this out to help you <a href="know.htm">know</a> I am able to think seriously about<br/>
design of complex systems.<br/>
<br/>
I have discovered a way to solve the problem you mention, but<br/>
understanding this approach requires a <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>amental r<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>sideration of<br/>
the meaning and purpose of organizing, so is not easy to digest.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I call the concept "<a href="imput.htm">Imput</a>ed <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion" which can be described briefly as:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>)</small> Attract middle-to-upper income consumers to "pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>" for goods and services.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>)</small> These pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ments are <a href="use.htm">use</a>d like regular inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a> <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s to buy <a href="land.htm">Land</a><br/>
and Capital and hire Labor.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>)</small> These inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s become <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers of those Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>)</small> The <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is not sold, but is distributed directly to each<br/>
consumer/inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>/<a href="own.htm">own</a>er according to the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> they paid.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>)</small> The return for risk in this case is not <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, but is instead the<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t itself.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>)</small> Notice this ROI is *<a href="ide.htm">ide</a>ntical* to the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> those consumers would<br/>
have otherwise paid if they were buying that <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t in the market.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let's consider a simple example comparing the two approaches:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h4">====</span><br/>
- A regular inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a> invests $X in a Fruit and Nut orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a>.<br/>
<br/>
- His return is <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> ... which is the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e and <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
- This <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>off is based on the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a that some consumers will <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> more<br/>
than it <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s to buy those goods.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h4">====</span><br/>
- A consumer-inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a> invests $X in a Fruit and Nut orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a>.<br/>
<br/>
- His return is <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t ... which he receives at *<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>*.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> to be considered because the last transaction <small>(buying the<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t)</small> does not even occur - that transaction is '<a href="imput.htm">imput</a>ed' because<br/>
of the consumer's <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;He <a href="own.htm">own</a>s the Peaches<br/>
already, as a "side effect" of his <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the Peach tree.<br/>
<br/>
- This <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>off is based on the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a that some consumers will pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a><br/>
for goods that they will recieve at <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Consumers that do not invest and <a href="own.htm">own</a> must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> to 'regular'<br/>
inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s for the risk those inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s took.<br/>
<br/>
Consumers that DO invest and <a href="own.htm">own</a> are taking risk upon themselves, but<br/>
cannot <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, for <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is undefined when the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t is not<br/>
sold.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t is not sold because it is already the<br/>
<a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of those who will <a href="use.htm">use</a> it = the consumers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me <a href="know.htm">know</a> what you think.<br/>
