<br/>
It fits well with a metaphor I have<br/>
struggled to convey in a pleasing<br/>
manner - where the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s should<br/>
accept the roles to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>, guard,<br/>
and generally support the welfare<br/>
of those who have the <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s to do<br/>
the <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>ding that must be done.<br/>
<br/>
This includes shouldering the risks<br/>

and maintaining all of the Physical<br/>
<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es any <a href="art.htm">art</a>isans will need to<br/>
accomplish the goals of '<a href="buil.htm">buil</a>ding'.<br/>
<br/>
I believe we must eventually also<br/>
include a way to supply a sort of<br/>
"Basic Outcome" for those players<br/>
so they don't need to worry about<br/>
the distracting problems of food,<br/>
shelter, basic health care, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I envision a wide variety of these<br/>
structures - at least one for each<br/>
kind of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t that any subgroup<br/>
within a community may want.<br/>
<br/>
Each subgroup of <a href="user.htm">user</a>s buys or <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s<br/>
the construction of such a structure<br/>
<small>(say a milk dairy or Avocado orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a>)</small><br/>
and then attract those with <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s and<br/>
the desire to operate those <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es by<br/>
offering to operate some <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es in<br/>
the community for which they have<br/>
<a href="skill.htm">skill</a> and desire <small>(say fixing teeth or<br/>
shoveling manure)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Operating in this way will allow us to<br/>
minimize the need to <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e goods while<br/>
maximizing our opportunities to <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e<br/>
a wider variety of <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s which will <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e<br/>

will be <a href="lib.htm">lib</a>erated from the monotony<br/>
and repetition of doing the same <a href="job.htm">job</a><br/>
for much longer than we might want<br/>

<br/>
We could open a grocery <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>e where<br/>

<br/>
It is important to charge <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> against<br/>
late comers because if we don't, the<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t will be far too cheap - causing<br/>
a sort of 'scalping' where middle-men<br/>
would buy all of the low-<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e goods<br/>

This is similar to the hybrid <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing approach I am trying to finalize now.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence I <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ose is that 50% of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>s be treated as though it<br/>
were a <a href="real.htm">real</a> investment from and for the <a href="user.htm">user</a> who paid it - so the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s<br/>
gain *<a href="real.htm">real</a>* <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> as it grows.<br/>
<br/>
This creates a strange dynamic where <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is incrementally eliminated<br/>
for those <a href="user.htm">user</a>s who <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> it long enough - since <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers don't need to buy<br/>
the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t from themselves, but <a href="own.htm">own</a> it already as a result of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the<br/>
<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es - and from <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing the re<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ing <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
This leaves only a "Growth Edge" for <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ers to reap <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>s;<br/>
one which will expand in circumference, but will leave a wake of <a href="user.htm">User</a>-<br/>
<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ed <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion in it's path - effectively destroying the 'market' for<br/>
that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t for any other competitor, since how can a Capitalist possibly<br/>
compete with at-<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion that <a href="user.htm">User</a>-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership provides?<br/>
<br/>
This will be <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion Of, By, and For the People, but not centralized to<br/>

can <a href="imag.htm">imag</a>ine is the one called <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent pwners CANNOT do the right<br/>

When you say '<a href="cost.htm">cost</a>', I wonder if you are talking about the '<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e'<br/>
a consumer <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if that seems nit-<a href="pic.htm">pic</a>king, but it is very important that we<br/>

the magical value called <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, and <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is *undefined* when<br/>
consumers <small>(co-)</small><a href="own.htm">own</a> the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
For example, you must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all of the initial and re<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ing <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s<br/>
to <a href="install.htm">install</a> and maintain a <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> within your home, but you do<br/>

so can only <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s, while <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is meaningless.<br/>
<br/>
This is profoundly significant considering the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y<br/>
the corporate ISPs celebrate as 'earnings' each Quarter.<br/>
<br/>
We, the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s, <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> that extra value called <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, and yet we<br/>
never gain <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in those <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>s, and so remain<br/>
dependent upon those 'providers'.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is something that we must charge against non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers,<br/>
during growth, but we must treat that overpayment as an<br/>
investment from those late-comers which we will <a href="use.htm">use</a> to grow<br/>
the size of the <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>, but will finally 'vest' to those <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ers<br/>
as their <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership - so the <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> can scale without<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> Some round figures: $25 times 150 million voters is $3,750,000,000.</span><br/>

<br/>
I <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;We, the People, must invest to <a href="fund.htm">fund</a> and <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> the physical<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> Anyway, because of the frame<a href="work.htm">work</a> envisioned for its <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership and</span><br/>
