<br/>
Non-Ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riate.&nbsp;&nbsp;To not ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riate.&nbsp;&nbsp;To not take <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership?&nbsp;&nbsp;To be without <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty?<br/>
<br/>
The word '<a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty' begins with '<a href="proper.htm">proper</a>'.<br/>
<br/>
Actions are arbitrarily deemed '<a href="proper.htm">proper</a>' and 'ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riate' according to who <a href="own.htm">OWN</a>S the associated physical re-<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
Notice Ryan says you must write to the P2P Research List *<a href="own.htm">OWN</a>ER*.<br/>
<br/>
This is clearly a microcosm of what can and will happen within a '<a href="real.htm">real</a>' P2P community unless we design some sort of internal ruleset to fend against too-powerful <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>...<br/>
<br/>
At first I was disinterested and maybe a bit annoyed about your experiment because it seemed to be distracting us from the '<a href="real.htm">real</a>' issue of getting P2P going for the physical side of things.<br/>
<br/>
But thinking last night it <small>(finally)</small> dawned on me this is small but <a href="real.htm">real</a>-life example of some of the very issues we will face when P2P is finally operating the material world.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>...<br/>
<br/>
I like to think about how things might <a href="work.htm">work</a> in a physical P2P <a href="work.htm">Work</a>shop.<br/>
<br/>
How will we decide what temperature to set the thermo<a href="stat.htm">stat</a>?<br/>
<br/>
How will we schedule access to the kitchen?<br/>
<br/>
How will we decide where to put the loud music or TV or video <a href="game.htm">game</a>s <small>(audio pollution to some)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Will we be able to decide anything whatsoever?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>...<br/>
<br/>
Capitalism is a dictatorship of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers with policy enforced by 'police' <small>(policy enforcers)</small> they hire to keep things "in line" according to those <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers' personal whims.<br/>
<br/>
In Capitalism the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers may declare any arbitrary policy, and we <small>(the non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ing consumers)</small> must abide or be cast out.<br/>
<br/>
That is the same for how the P2PResearch e<a href="mail.htm">mail</a> list is being operated.&nbsp;&nbsp;Michel is the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er <small>(well, he may be <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ing from someone else who has an even more 'ultimate' say)</small> and Ryan Lanham is one of his policy enforcers.<br/>
<br/>
I don't have *any* say in how things operate because I have no <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership and I think the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers <small>(Michel)</small> barely tolerate my presence.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a totalitarian situation that is certainly NOT how I <a href="pic.htm">pic</a>ture <a href="real.htm">real</a> P2P.<br/>
<br/>
Some restaurants require men wear suit-coats.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a stupid policy in my mind, but they ARE the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers after all, so I think they should be able to require it.<br/>
<br/>
Even though <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty privatization and excessive <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is a major problem right now <small>(I can barely afford to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for water already because I am <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing both <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s AND <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> since my city is leasing water from a private corporation instead of holding the 'final' water for "we the people"...)</small>,<br/>
<br/>
I believe <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership can be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d in our favor if we can discover how to constrain "<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers" from gaining excessive advantage over non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers during <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
The beginning of my 'fix' to this problem is by groups of consumers becoming <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers of physical assets such as a <a href="web.htm">web</a>-server or a restaurant or a bus or whatever so that *they* set their *<a href="own.htm">own</a>* policies instead of some absentee <a href="land.htm">land</a>lord.<br/>
<br/>
Having <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership brings the fight 'home', and finally gives each consumer-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er a <a href="real.htm">real</a> footing according to the % of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in each specific physical re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
So if I have 21% <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in a roto-tiller, I have 21% 'say' <small>(a literal and potent 'vote')</small> in how that <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine is to be treated.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>..<br/>
<br/>
But what happens when 51% of the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of some physical thing want policy to be in one direction while 49% want the policy in a mutually-exclusive 'other' direction <small>(such as requiring suit-coat or not, trimming e<a href="mail.htm">mail</a> messeages or not, having the lights on or off, etc.)</small>?<br/>
<br/>
Today we suffer the Tyranny of the Majority without any <a href="real.htm">real</a>istic means of secession.<br/>
<br/>
But if we had *<a href="real.htm">real</a>* <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, then we might be able to *split* the re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e during such an im<a href="pass.htm">pass</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>...<br/>
<br/>
For now, we non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ing consumers <small>(<a href="user.htm">user</a>s)</small> have no <a href="real.htm">real</a> rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can only hope the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers decide our choices are <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>.<br/>
<br/>
We need to "get together" to <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> a physical <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter and <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> <small>(though in the end need to <a href="own.htm">own</a>)</small> the internet connection for that <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine and allow anyone else that is willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> to also become a <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>er so we can have sharable control of e<a href="mail.htm">mail</a>, <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age, <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>tation, etc.<br/>
<br/>
If we can accomplish this for something as relatively cheap as a <a href="http.htm">HTTP</a>/FTP/<a href="imap.htm">IMAP</a>/<a href="smtp.htm">SMTP</a>/etc. server, then we might be able to pound-out some of these same issues in the context of <a href="real.htm">real</a>, <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>, ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riate <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>

I understand <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently considered necessary<br/>

But what if the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s were the very people intending<br/>

<br/>
They would be compensated with "at-<a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t alone,<br/>

If we could get a large number of people to pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for such a thing,<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
The important point is that they are the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers,<br/>
for when <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers and Consumers are the same, <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is undefined.<br/>
