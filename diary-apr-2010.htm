Similar to how the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> <a href="use.htm">use</a>s Copyright to solve the problems of Copyright, we can <a href="use.htm">use</a> <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty rights to solve the problems of <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty rights.<br/>
<br/>
Copy<a href="left.htm">left</a> seems hypocritical because it *requires* Copyright to enforce it's solution to power concentration within the <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual <small>(sacred or spiritual)</small> world.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty<a href="left.htm">Left</a> is a analogous approach that will <a href="use.htm">use</a> <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty rights to enforce a solution to power in the physical <small>(profane or bodily)</small> <a href="real.htm">real</a>m.<br/>
<br/>
So the first step is to allow ourselves the notion that we can <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es such as Farms and Factories in a 'moral' or 'righteous' manner.<br/>
<br/>
Then we must write the contract that we will choose to apply to such <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty for the purpose of ensuring <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom for all of it's <a href="user.htm">User</a>s <small>(Consumers)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers of "Intellectual <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty" *choose* to tie their <a href="own.htm">own</a> hands - and the hands of anyone else <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>ding upon those re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es - when the *choose* to apply the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> to their '<a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty'.<br/>
<br/>
We, as <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers of <a href="real.htm">real</a>, meat<a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty can also *choose* to tie our hands - and the hands of anyone <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>ding upon that <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty - through a "Terms of Operation" that treats <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> as a <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er's investment.<br/>
<br/>
This will allow us to grow while keeping us from 'accidentally' overaccumulating wealth and power into the hands of the few that begin the operation.<br/>

<span class="bullet">.</span>..<br/>
<span class="quot">> fall short and only <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e up a tiny share of the overall market.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> Why is this the case?</span><br/>
<br/>
The most <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>amental problem with these entities is that they do not <a href="use.htm">use</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty rights to eliminate the exchange of goods.<br/>
<br/>
What I mean is easier to understand using an extremely simplified example:<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of a nut tree must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, including any Wages if he doesn't do all of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> himself.<br/>
<br/>
But he cannot <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> because he does not 'buy' the nuts at the end of the season - they are *already* his <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
When this <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el is scaled through <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership - when a group of Consumers purchase a grove of nut trees with the understanding that they *<a href="own.htm">own</a>* the output of those trees in an a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> directly related to the % of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership they have in the orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a>, then <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e == <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> and <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> == 0.<br/>
<br/>
But one more detail that must be addressed is the case where the Consumer accidentally <a href="own.htm">own</a>s more of the orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> <small>(Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es)</small> than they need to satisfy their <a href="own.htm">own</a> needs.<br/>
<br/>
In that case we <small>(the group of <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ing consumers)</small> should <a href="use.htm">use</a> "the market" to sell that excess to other consumers that do not yet have sufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> <small>(for if they did, they would not need to buy nuts)</small> but under a strict condition that any a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> we charge over the <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> in<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ed for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion must be treated as an Investment from the consumer who paid it.&nbsp;&nbsp;This perpetuates the elimination of exchange.<br/>
<br/>
This arrangement will outperform the "<a href="free.htm">Free</a> Market" because the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s are the consumers and expect only <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t in return, and so these organizations can saely allow <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e to reach <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> and are also not threatened by automation or robotics or abundance in general.<br/>

<hr/><span class="date">Apr-28-2010:</span> <a href="user.htm">User</a>s <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es creates a "Zero Copy" environment where goods are no longer exchanged because they are already the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of those who will consume them.<br/>

<span class="quot">> The caveat, attended a session at the summit on Social Business where</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> there was a discussion regarding <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.</span><br/>
<br/>
I'm glad you bring up the issue of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The connection to <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is not clear.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> can be thought of as the inverse to Consumer <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
When a Consumer <a href="own.htm">own</a>s the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <small>(say an Olive Tree)</small>, he then receives the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t <small>(Olives in this case)</small> exactly "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>".&nbsp;&nbsp;He can't <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, for who would he <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> it to?<br/>
<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion is kindof "short-circuited" under the special condition of <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>er == <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect-Consumer.<br/>
<br/>
When the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er of the Olive Tree eats a fruit for himself, he didn't avoid <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing any <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s, but what he does avoid <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing is <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
He can't <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, because that occurs at the point-of-sale, but since he already <a href="own.htm">own</a>s the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t <small>(Olives)</small> as a side-effect of his <a href="own.htm">OWN</a>ing the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <small>(Olive Trees)</small>, the last transaction <small>(buying Olives)</small> doesn't ever occur.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> The problem with <a href="profit.htm">profit</a></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> seems to be twofold, firstly where it is maximised at the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of the</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> customers, society and the environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;S<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>dly where the <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> are distributed almost solely to the shareholders and executives.</span><br/>
<br/>
Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;My solution to the 2nd problem is to write a "Terms of Operation" which we can <a href="use.htm">use</a> to begin new, special organizations that choose to abide and enforce <small>(over their <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty)</small> the rule that "<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is to be treated as an Investment from the Consumer who Paid it.".<br/>
<br/>
By doing this, the community is still able to grow <small>(using that <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e and <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>)</small>, but the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership of that growth is automatically distributed to the person who was willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for it.<br/>
<br/>
The solution to the first problem is implicitly contained within the implementation of the rule, since any corporation choosing to <a href="use.htm">use</a> these "Terms of Operation" will have no reason to maximize <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>s other than to speed the growth of that local community.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, with regards to problem #1, <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>s will naturally taper toward zero since a side-effect of Consumers gaining <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is that they no longer <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> - it becomes undefined.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> To have a viable self-sustaining business, you absolutely have to have</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> full <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <a href="recover.htm">recover</a>y.</span><br/>
<br/>
Yes, I <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> If you have <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> on top of that, you can afford</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> to invest in the training and development of your people.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> afford to invest in equipment and other <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> improve the compensation of your people. You can afford to <a href="employ.htm">employ</a> more</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> people.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can cross-subsidise the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts and services so</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> as to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e them affordable and accessible to those who would not</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> otherwise be able to <a href="use.htm">use</a> them.</span><br/>
<br/>
Yes, this is true and somewhat good in that we, as Com<a href="mone.htm">mone</a>rs, will need to "grow" our holdings to replace the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent system.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not that we need more total <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion on the Earth nearly as much as the <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of those Means must be 'corrected' so they are held by the very humans for which that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is supposedly occuring <small>(the Consumers)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
But treating <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as we do now causes growth to be concentrated into the hands of the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers instead of becoming the <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty of those who paid for it.<br/>

Fabio, thanks for the kind words and for trying to merge this with your <a href="own.htm">own</a> understandings.<br/>

<br/>
There is a large psychological hurdle constructed by a long hi<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>y of thinking those who have the <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s needed to operate the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion must be the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to conjure <a href="imag.htm">imag</a>es of a class of NON-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ing_<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers fending for themselves while the class of <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ing_Consumers roll around, pushing buttons from a couch.<br/>
<br/>
This is an unfortunate and inaccurate depiction of what I <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ose.&nbsp;&nbsp;We *all* are Consumers of at least *some* things.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is impossible for any human to continue <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>ing unless he consumes the output of a certain subset of <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>ing organisms.<br/>
<br/>
We actually *do* want <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> the <a href="work.htm">Work</a>er, but instead of <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ing his supposed 'need' to <a href="work.htm">work</a>, we must <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> his <a href="real.htm">real</a> need to Consume.<br/>
<br/>
This allows us to _safely_ drive <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s <small>(even Wages)</small> as low as possible, and to _safely_ automate and even eliminate <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ment when possible without crisis.<br/>

<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> only occurs when Consumers do not <a href="own.htm">own</a> the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
When groups of Consumers organize to purchase and therefore <a href="own.htm">OWN</a> farms and factories, then <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> can safely reach zero, since the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment those Consumers expect is the *<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t* itself.<br/>
<br/>
So <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is an inverse measure of competition.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or another way is to say <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> measures Consumer dependence upon the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
We should not be trying to perpetuate <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> by <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ping-up <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>es, but should instead treat that overpayment as an Investment from the Consumer who Paid it.<br/>
<br/>
Treating <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er Investment is a "negative feed<a href="back.htm">back</a> loop" that allows growth while simultaneously 'distributing' that growth to those that are willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for it.<br/>
<br/>
Notice this is also an auto-leveling system that avoids the now systemic problem of over-accumulation that Capitalism suffers.<br/>
<br/>
Within such an investment plan, growth "tapers off" as demand is filled <small>(as Consumers gain <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion)</small> and does not promote overconsumption caused when we strive to perpetuate <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
'Normal' investment techniques cannot withstand perfect competition because typical inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s are expecting to be paid the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e and <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> which requires Consumers NOT have <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion, for under conditions of Consumer <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership, <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e == <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> and <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> == 0!<br/>

<br/>
The most important of these constraints is that <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> must be treated as an Investment from the Consumer who Paid it.&nbsp;&nbsp;By doing this, we create a system that allows everyone who <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipates to eventually gain the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership they need to also have "fair access" just as you hope for though maybe in a way that for now seems too perverted to consider.<br/>

I'm talking about the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s an *<a href="own.htm">OWN</a>ER* of the "Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion" must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, and the final <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e a *CONSUMER* must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> to receive that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let's consider the case of a simple business selling lemonade.<br/>
<br/>
The way I frame the situation is:<br/>
<br/>
Before <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion has even begun, the business <a href="own.htm">OWN</a>ER will <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s to begin.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;<small>[Structured in the <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>/wage/interest form you are accustomed]</small>:<br/>
<a href="cost.htm">COST</a>#1: He will buy or <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> or go into debt for some <a href="land.htm">Land</a>.<br/>
<a href="cost.htm">COST</a>#2: He will <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> wages to a <a href="work.htm">work</a>er or spend his <a href="own.htm">own</a> time doing that labor.<br/>
<a href="cost.htm">COST</a>#3: He will buy or <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> or go into debt for some Tools.<br/>
<br/>
Once <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is underway, the <a href="own.htm">OWN</a>ER may begin selling some <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
When he sells the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t, he will try to get Consumers to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> more for the finished <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t than it *<a href="real.htm">real</a>ly* <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e that <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
I am not saying this is 'good' or 'bad', I am just <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ing the way I understand things, and asking if this sounds reasonable, and whether it seems valuable for discussion.<br/>
<br/>
So my equation looks like:<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> = Consumer_<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e - <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am confused about the equation <small>{Wealth - <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> - wage - interest = <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>}</small> because I don't understand where Consumer_<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e fits.<br/>
