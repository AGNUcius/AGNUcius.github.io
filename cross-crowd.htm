<br/>
1.)</small> A <a href="promis.htm">Promis</a>e-to-<a href="work.htm">work</a> is another type of Investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means some Consumers will prepay <small>(think a variant of crowd <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>ing mixed with scheduled time-<a href="bank.htm">bank</a>ing)</small> by committing to <a href="work.htm">work</a> in the future in return for <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t is the Inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>'s return.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is never sold <small>(except surplus as defined in #3)</small> because each <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>er has spread their investments across all the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion for which they predict they will need the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects, and in just enough to receive the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> the need.&nbsp;&nbsp;This eliminates <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> because the final transaction does not occur.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is <a href="know.htm">know</a>n as <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic <a href="imput.htm">imput</a>ation.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="h4">====Growth:</span><br/>
As the agriculture begins to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e, most of the output is not sold, but is already the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of each inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a> according to the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty they <a href="own.htm">own</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Most inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s will eventually have surplus <small>(especially after a few years of growth and natural regeneration of species)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Each inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a> can choose to do whatever they like with their <a href="own.htm">own</a> surplus except for one specific constraint: "<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> must be treated as <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er Investment".<br/>
<br/>
For example, say you have 100 extra lbs of Olives. You can turn these into oil and try to burn them in a diesel engine, or you can offer them as a sacrifice to your God, or you can sell them to your neighbor *but* if you sell them, you must treat any a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s as though the buyer had made an investment in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Separating <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> from Wages is a bit complicated.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do all of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> of selling the Olives, then you can claim that everything the buyer paid beyond any other <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s you may have in<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ed is your Wages for doing that <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
That is completely fine, even if it seems you are overpaying yourself.<br/>
<br/>
But if you hire someone to sell the Olives, or <small>(and this next case will be the most common)</small> if you just let the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>ehouse sell any of your surplus for you, then those <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers will be paid wages that are easily separated from <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>s, and so all you will receive are the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s needed to cover that over<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion - so you will usually "break even" with regards to any surplus but never "<a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e a <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>".<br/>
<br/>
This means you will want to <a href="own.htm">own</a> just enough of each <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> as you need of each <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t except you will likely want to <a href="own.htm">own</a> just a little bit more as a sort of '<a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance' against the possibility lean years of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion caused by drought or pestilence, etc.<br/>
