<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> measures <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty misallocation.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty is the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
When the consumers of outputs are <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of inputs, the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is not sold, and so <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e and <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s are the same and <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is undefined.<br/>
<br/>
A <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>e to <a href="work.htm">work</a> in the future is another kind of investment.<br/>
<br/>
When <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers commit to <a href="work.htm">work</a> for others within a <a href="cross-crowd.htm">Cross-Crowd</a> organization, those <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers receive a bundle of <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty and <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>es we call the <a href="iota.htm">IOTA</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is separated from wages as the number of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers per physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e increases.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers are then hired by the collecitve <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers explicitly instead of the labor being 'assumed' by some of the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers who may otherwise overpay themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Consumers already <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s <small>(including Wages)</small> AND they are <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing the <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s which the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers <a href="title.htm">title</a> "<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>".&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumers <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> more than <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> when they don't control <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es because they cannot "go around" the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers unless they were to buy some of their <a href="own.htm">own</a> Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es and <a href="start.htm">start</a> a fully separate corporation.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the goal of such a venture would most likely be the same as the business it was meant to out-compete: to keep <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
When a consumer <a href="own.htm">own</a>s the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es required for the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects he <a href="use.htm">use</a>s, he might <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> other <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers to change the inputs into the outputs while he <a href="work.htm">work</a>s at his <a href="own.htm">own</a> specialty, but that Wage would be a <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
Consumers who <a href="own.htm">own</a> Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es can't <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> unless they were to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> it to themselves as an investment toward future <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers separate Wages from <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> for a Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e when they allow all possible <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers to compete for those <a href="job.htm">job</a>s - with the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>al candidate having the highest <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>/wage ratio but usually with a <a href="skill.htm">skill</a> level minimum and a wage maximum.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers are also Consumers.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers needs food, water, shelter, clothing, sanitation, transportation, education, etc. and expect other people to apply their <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s so he can buy lunch after <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ing his labor.<br/>
<br/>
But there are barriers to <a href="trad.htm">Trad</a>e <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think of this as a matter of re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e allocation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans are mostly innocent because of ignorance.<br/>
<br/>
It is a technical 'performance' issue related to the mis-distribution of <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership that results in a very inefficient system with larger <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers clearly <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing against the rest of society only because we misunderstand the meaning of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Typical corporations have incentive to stop <a href="real.htm">real</a> progress and permanent solutions because <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> requires consumers NOT have control of the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
So "The <a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omy" has for-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> corporations in a strange position where they FAIL <small>(by definition)</small> when a consumer can get <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t "At <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>" because <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is nothing more than keeping <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> *REQUIRES* the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect consumer be dependent upon the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, and may be minimized by treating it as an investment from the consumer who paid it.&nbsp;&nbsp;This distributes control and independence <small>(<a href="free.htm">free</a>dom)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>...<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between consumer_<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e and <a href="own.htm">own</a>er_<a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would anyone seeking to solve the <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic troubles we face want to keep <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>?&nbsp;&nbsp;Must we perpetuate poverty for most to <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> for the few?<br/>
<br/>
If everyone in world had "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" access to bread, would you say bread has no value?&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll bet the starving Haitians wouldn't <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Isn't "<a href="use.htm">use</a> value" worth considering?<br/>
<br/>
Of course things lose "exchange value" as we approach abundance, but that only proves that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is an inverse measure of development.<br/>
<br/>
We don't NEED to keep <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> when the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s and the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers are the same set.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wage is also a <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>, and <a href="work.htm">work</a> is paid before <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is even <a href="calc.htm">calc</a>ulated.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="user.htm">User</a>s are willing to invest in "for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t" <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion for the purpose of "<a href="use.htm">use</a> value" alone.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="user.htm">User</a>s already <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s anyway, and they ALSO <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> "<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" <small>(<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> whenever they do not yet have sufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the means of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <small>(the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es)</small> required to meet those <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ectives.<br/>
<br/>
A for-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> mindset thinks <span class="quot">"'how can we, as separate entities, capture value.'"</span>, but what <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es us think the founders of an enterprise MUST remain divided from the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s it was supposedly created for?&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't we want to create true public utilities?<br/>
<br/>
Governments at all levels and every non-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> corporation and/or organization keep control away from the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s they claim to serve by not understanding the "<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" those <a href="user.htm">user</a>s <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> should be considered an INVESTMENT from the very <a href="user.htm">user</a> that paid it - for the only reason a <a href="user.htm">user</a> <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s the portion called <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is because the do not yet have enough control to achieve those goals "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>".<br/>

The "<a href="land.htm">Land</a> <a href="rent.htm">Rent</a>" <small>(or "Single Tax")</small> of Henry George has a large a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> to do with sprawl and excessive transport of humans.<br/>

Permaculture addresses the movement of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t by putting it at our doorstep.<br/>
<br/>
We become more vulnerable as the beast grows these heavier <a href="art.htm">art</a>eries with the <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s we give them every time we <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> a <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> against us is a microcosm of the Military Industrial Complex based wars that we are fooled into believing are about righteousness and goodness.<br/>
<br/>
Every purchase we <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e is a concentration of power into the hands of Nestle, General Mills, ConAgra, Hershey's, Dole, Monsanto, ...&nbsp;&nbsp;They <a href="use.htm">use</a> that power against us to ensure their reign.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their reign is held in place through simple <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion needed to re-create our daily bread.<br/>
<br/>
We must purchase <a href="land.htm">land</a> and grow heirloom foods that will soon be extinct or outlawed if the <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>eers have their way.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>eers will continue to have their way only for as long as we continue to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> them.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> them for as long as we do not have a <a href="real.htm">real</a>istic alternative.<br/>
<br/>
Let's <a href="work.htm">work</a> together to design and implement a <a href="real.htm">real</a>istic alternative that keeps control and <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e as local as possible.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Many tend to think rivalry <small>(finiteness)</small> is limited to certain *TYPES* of things <small>(such as a loaf of bread or a washing <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine)</small>, while we simultaneously mistakenly believe other things <small>(such as movies and software)</small> have no rivalry whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
Whether software or bread, everything is infinite <small>(non-rivalrous)</small> in potential, yet <a href="real.htm">real</a>istically constrained <small>(rivalrous)</small> in it's actualization.<br/>
<br/>
A movie is obviously non-rivalrous in that the number of potential copies is infinite, but it is also constrained by the rivalrous <a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e, time, mass and energy required to create, <a href="use.htm">use</a>, <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify, copy and share it.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is common to brush off these hosting <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s as being 'marginal', but if they are so unimportant, why don't we just <a href="start.htm">start</a> a video hosting site today to replace YouTube?&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly pretend the warehouses of servers Google <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s for are not physical constraints?&nbsp;&nbsp;And it doesn't end there.&nbsp;&nbsp;That movie cannot be utilized unless it is copied, which of course takes time, and consumes physical re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es including the twisted-copper, fiber optics or satellite <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ware <small>(mass)</small> to transmit it, and a local <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter <small>(more mass)</small> and electricity <small>(energy)</small> and even <a href="land.htm">land</a> <small>(<a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e)</small> to house these things.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, once the mechanical design of a washing <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine <small>(the type)</small> has been created by an engineer, what are the potential number of washing <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hines <small>(instances)</small> that can be <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed <small>(how many times may it be copied)</small>?&nbsp;&nbsp;The design is just as infinite in potential <small>(non-rivalrous)</small> as the movie, yet is also constrained by <a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e, time, mass and energy again.<br/>
<br/>
Wheat is actually just a design <small>(DNA or genetics)</small> that has been 'applied' to the Mass called 'dust' or 'clay' or 'sand', and the Mass called 'water' using a little bit of <a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e <small>(<a href="land.htm">land</a>)</small> and some SUN for energy.&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer and breadmaker apply their <a href="own.htm">own</a> designs as they harvest, thresh, grind, mix, knead, bake and cut to specialize that mass into a finished <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
But software also requires Mass for <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age <small>(a <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>-drive, CD, DVD, RAM, even paper or your brain if you have not yet entered it into a <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter)</small> and a physical input device <small>(such as a <a href="key.htm">key</a>board or microphone)</small> for creation and an output device <small>(such as a <a href="moni.htm">moni</a>tor or speakers)</small> for "expression".&nbsp;&nbsp;This Mass also requires it's <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="spac.htm">Spac</a>e to exist and of course software has little value if it can't be "expressed" by temporarily applying that design to a completed <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter components using electricity for energy.<br/>
<br/>
While the time and personal energy <small>(labor)</small> needed to copy a grain of wheat appears to be much more than downloading a copy of a program and running it, if we factor in all the re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es required to manufacture the <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ware and supply the electricity as compared to allowing nature to <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agate the seed, it may not be as much of a <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence as we <a href="imag.htm">imag</a>ine.<br/>
<br/>
So, even though <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> TYPES of things require <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> A<a href="mount.htm">MOUNT</a>S of physical re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es for their <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, the fact remains that all things have infinite potential, and all things are <a href="real.htm">real</a>istically constrained by <a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e, time, mass and energy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect Oriented <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion -- The Goals of Political <a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omy<br/>
<br/>
Any software developer <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ing "<a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect Oriented Programming" <small>(OOP)</small> understands the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between the 'type' and 'instance' of an <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect.&nbsp;&nbsp;An <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect type is mostly defined as the design <small>(code, methods or accessors)</small> and any <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e <small>(data, variables or slots)</small> that will be shared among all instantiations of that type.&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, an <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect instance is primarily defined by the extra re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es required to <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>iate it as an separable, individual 'copy' of that type of thing.<br/>
<br/>
In the '<a href="real.htm">real</a>' world, the type of something might be thought of as all of the cumulative design applied to all of the physical re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es required for it's <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="virt.htm">Virt</a>ual <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es are information such as <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>as, plans, design, intellect, software, video, audio, genetics, etc. which must be <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>ed and expressed by physical <a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e, mass and energy.<br/>
<br/>
Because of their inescapable connection to physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual things can never actually be copied for zero <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even across the internet there are <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s for both the server and the client such as: bandwidth, slightly higher electricity to run the NIC, more CPU time to run the kernel <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ule that controls the NIC, the <a href="user.htm">user</a><a href="mod.htm">mod</a>e applications that serve and receive the data, RAM dedicated to that process and <a href="hard.htm">Hard</a> Drive <a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e needed to <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>e the <a href="new.htm">new</a> copy.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the '<a href="cost.htm">cost</a>' of the exclusivity of those physical re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es to that data and activity during those time slices.&nbsp;&nbsp;This may seem an un<a href="real.htm">real</a>istic academic exercise, but it <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly isn't if we scale the problem toward the upper extreme.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine these <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s for <a class="ext" href="http://YouTube.com">YouTube.com</a>, <a class="ext" href="http://Video.Google.com">Video.Google.com</a>, etc. when they are servicing millions of customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a very big deal indeed and requires huge rooms with expensive cooling equipment <small>(I once read the cooling is commonly more expensive than the electricity for the <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ters)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Each instance requires more physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es to <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age and expression.&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es are the rivalrous, material aspects of <a href="real.htm">real</a>ity such as <a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e, time, mass and energy required to host<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t <small>(<a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects)</small>, not <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is simply the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e a consumer <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s for an <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect<small>(ive)</small>, and the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es paid for it's <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Beer!<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span> Wages are a <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion paid by <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers to <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers.<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span> <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers specialize by <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ing labor through barter or a <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency.<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span> Competition and Subtle Monopoly.<br/>
<br/>
Competition is perfected <small>(though would rarely be perfect)</small> when the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> a consumer <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> is treated as that consumer's investment in more physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.&nbsp;&nbsp;When an <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect <a href="user.htm">user</a> is also the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of all the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es required for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <small>(recursively, along the entire chain of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion)</small>, <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is then 'undefined' since the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment of such would only be a <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment to himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;This even scales to the smallest case of a single stranded is<a href="land.htm">land</a>er.&nbsp;&nbsp;All '<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment' in that case is pure <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and "<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" would simply be an investment toward future <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <small>(for instance, planting some coconuts to replace older, dying trees)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Perfect competition would require the consumers <small>(<a href="user.htm">user</a>s)</small> have control, not the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers. That control can be delivered as <a href="real.htm">real</a> controlling shares of collective private <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es <small>(or toward the purchase of similar <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es when there are no shares of the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent factory or farm "up for sale")</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Another way to think about "<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>" is to understand it as a plea from Consumers to Grow and have Control.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consumer is saying "I can't get bread any other way, so am willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er more than it <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e it because I am in a bind.".<br/>
<br/>
In this way we see the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> called "<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>" would <small>(in a better world)</small> be an automatic investment for that Consumer in the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion needed to create more of that kind of <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consumer should become a <a href="part.htm">part</a>ial controlling shareholder in the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion for that <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect according to the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> he <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s above <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s, so, after each iteration, Consumers will move closer to being <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers in the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of the things <small>(plants, tools, water, <a href="land.htm">land</a>, etc.)</small> that are required to <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e their future needs are met.<br/>
<br/>
But, since people's tastes change, this should be an incremental and continuous process that happens anytime an <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect changes hands.&nbsp;&nbsp;So holding this in place requires a sort of self-balancing constraint which can be implemented as an inter-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment similar to the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a> - but using contract law over physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es instead through Copyright over <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
Of course you <a href="know.htm">know</a> that if you <a href="own.htm">Own</a> a nut tree yourself, and are the only Consumer of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects of that tree, that "<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e" == "<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>", and "<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>" is meaningless.&nbsp;&nbsp;That does not mean you must be the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er.&nbsp;&nbsp;We very much want division of labor and specialization; and in many cases doing the <a href="work.htm">work</a> yourself is impossible because you simply don't have the <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership and labor is already separated in Capitalism, so this is no change at all.<br/>
<br/>
As <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect <a href="user.htm">User</a>s become <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers, <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ment can be safely minimized and there is no reason to hope other <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers fail, as abundance is always good, and scarcity is to be avoided.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the positive-feed<a href="back.htm">back</a> that can close the loop on an <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy and cause it to finally stabilize.<br/>

<span class="bullet">*</span> Abundance and <a href="real.htm">real</a> solutions are goal and never thought 'destructive'.<br/>

<span class="bullet">*</span> Entire <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion chains are finally localized.<br/>

<br/>
This is clear for a <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ic set of consumers, but demand changes over time while consumers come and go, so the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>iculty comes in <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing this re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e allocation 'dynamic'.<br/>
<br/>
The FSF's <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a> has been described as 'cancerous' and 'viral' because of it's dynamic nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;It requires the <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <small>(<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code, <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d scripts, etc.)</small> be made available to any <a href="user.htm">user</a> <small>(consumer)</small> that receives an <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect Instance under that law, regardless of <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;But physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es are very <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> because they are rivalrous and finite.<br/>

<br/>
<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers receive <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> when consumers <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> more than <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumers <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> more than <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> when they <a href="calc.htm">calc</a>ulate there is no better alternative.&nbsp;&nbsp;That <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is therefore a measure of consumer dependence and also a measure of monopoly.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wage is not <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>, it is a <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition only occurs between <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, never between non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ing <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers since no <a href="work.htm">work</a> can be done without access to physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public law.htm">General Public Law</a> offers consumers <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion whenever they <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> more than <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consumer of a <a href="gplv4.htm">GPLv4</a> <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect slowly gains joint control of the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es still available for investment; or grows the cooporation as those <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s are invested in more physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es <small>{<a href="land.htm">land</a>, <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>dings, plants, tools, water rights, etc.}</small> by the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> that consumer <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> for the last round of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
A social <a href="operating system.htm">Operating System</a> can stabilize when <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is an investment for the consumer that just paid it toward more physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to create more copies of that <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect type.&nbsp;&nbsp;This holds the <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy in a sort of tension that continually adjusts to the dynamic demands of <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect <a href="user.htm">user</a>s so the perfect case of <a href="user own.htm">user own</a>ership is always being approached, though never quite reached except for brief periods of time since community membership and consumer demand is always in flux.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is a measure of consumer vulnerability and increases with their dependence on <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is therefore a measure of power, and and inverse measure of <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is a plea from <a href="user.htm">user</a>s for growth that should be an investment in their name toward more physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of that type.&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, a <a href="user.htm">user</a> <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> indicates there is a demand higher than supply for that type of <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect, and is balanced by the <a href="user.htm">user</a> becoming a <a href="part.htm">part</a>ial controlling shareholder in some <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es that can be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e more of that kind of <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect.&nbsp;&nbsp;This creates nearly perfect competition between consumers.<br/>
<br/>
There is no reason to cause other <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers to fail when you do not rely upon the scarcity that <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ing <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects for usury requires.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e becomes <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> and <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> meaningless when consumers are <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of the plants, as they <a href="own.htm">own</a> the output even before it is <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, since our wants change, <a href="user.htm">user</a>s must continually become <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers according to that which they invest in, and slowly lose control of that which they neglect.<br/>
<br/>
When physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es are finally <a href="free.htm">free</a> <small>(though never zero <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>, as they are rivalrous)</small> we will not need to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> the act of <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing or be the least bit concerned about keeping wages at any minimum level.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="use.htm">use</a> of <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects we must assure, not our lack of leisure.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been fooled into believing <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ment is a need in itself instead of understanding it as <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> we should strive to overcome as we meet our true goal of abundance at minimal <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
A <a href="user.htm">user</a> that becomes an incremental <a href="part.htm">part</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>er in the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of his wants may choose to not <a href="work.htm">work</a> in those fields <small>(and in some cases would never qualify)</small>, but is finally in control as nature intended before vassal fealty disturbed personal sovereignty.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>...<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> inverts our original goals of abundance to those of <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity through destruction and pollution of all competing suppliers.&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is only true <small>(is only meaningful)</small> when <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect Consumers are not <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
When an <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect Consumer <small>(of say an apple)</small> <a href="own.htm">OWN</a>S the physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <small>(the tree, <a href="land.htm">land</a>, water rights, tools)</small> of it's <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, then he might <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> a <a href="work.htm">Work</a>er some Wage as a <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, but <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is undefined.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, if I <a href="own.htm">OWN</a> an apple orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> and sell you an apple, you will likely be willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> a <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> since you are not "set up" or 'developed' enough in that you don't already <a href="own.htm">OWN</a> the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Now, <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing a <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> is not something we should try to stop directly, as it is an accurate measure of your dependence, and therefore your desire to grow.<br/>
<br/>
Since you are willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> that <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence usually called <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, the best thing we <small>(<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers wishing to <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d community)</small> could do with that value is to treat it as an investment for you <small>(the Consumer)</small> in more physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es, or to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>off <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es that have already been purchased if the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers have trees up for sale.<br/>
<br/>
By doing this, the Consumers become the <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ers, <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers and controllers of their <a href="own.htm">own</a> instances of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tive <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es, and <small>(as kind of a side-effect)</small> they are also the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of all the potential <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion even before <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is complete.&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, an apple-tree <a href="own.htm">own</a>er also <a href="own.htm">own</a>s all the future apples that tree will ever <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
This <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>e of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion is a striking contrast to Marxism which would have the <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers be the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers and controllers.<br/>
<br/>
As <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect Consumers become <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers, <small>(this will never be 'perfect', as Consumer demand always changing, and hence <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership will continually 'flow')</small>, <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> disappears except as a measure of Consumer Growth - as it <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es no sense to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> more than <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> at that point unless you were to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> yourself!<br/>
