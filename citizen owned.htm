<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <small>(including wages)</small> but do not <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> and have complete control over those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="title.htm">title</a>s of '<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>er' and 'Consumer' inspire visions of two, mutually exclusive groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;But every <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>er must Consume, and every Consumer must <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>e unless that Consumer is a 'dependent' of some other <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>er <small>(such as infants, elderly, invalids, etc.)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>)</small> Consumers Prepay as a special type of investment where <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t is the Return.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>)</small> Those investments can be either Labor or <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es or <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>)</small> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is treated an investment from the Consumer who paid it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of Inputs is the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of Outputs.<br/>
<a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty in <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es gives <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty in <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is zero when a consumer of an <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect is the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of it's <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e equals <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> when a Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">own</a>er consumes the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
The typical <a href="own.htm">own</a>er who sells goods for <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>,<br/>
He takes that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as reward or to invest even further.<br/>
<br/>
When taken as reward, it incents bad behavior,<br/>
For <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> requires scarcity for perpetuation.<br/>
<br/>
When invested in more <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, that business will grow,<br/>
But that new <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty is now controlled by just a few.<br/>
<br/>
So <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion concentrates at each <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e.<br/>
While the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er gains nothing though it was he who paid!<br/>
<br/>
So what should we do with that a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>?<br/>
How could we treat <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> so control is not lost?<br/>
<br/>
Most organizations already invest that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> for growth.<br/>
But consider the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a> <small>(slightly coerced)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ers are the initial and re<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ing inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s,<br/>
And so should be the full and finally only <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Contract never requires an <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er to give or sell goods or services, only that <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es be made available "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" to those with which he does <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
Each Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e must be treated as maximally divisible to allow pre-emptive secession.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And how can we share without accidentally becoming one of the same beasts we <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently fight <small>(facebook, Google, etc.)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
We need a detailed description of what to do and what not to do at each step so we can finally create a business <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el that is better than *either* of Capitalism or Corporatism.<br/>
<br/>
This "Code of Conduct" would be a legal document that members of any group could apply to any material assets they intend to share.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So let's <a href="start.htm">start</a> with just 2 people and see what we can discover:<br/>
<br/>
If 2 people are sharing some tangible <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect <small>(say a <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter)</small>, is there such a thing as <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>?<br/>
<br/>
The 2 people must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s to purchase, <a href="install.htm">install</a>, maintain, etc. the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine.<br/>
<br/>
But they do not <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> - for who would they <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> it to?<br/>
<br/>
Neither do they 'earn' <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, but are instead paid in '<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t'.<br/>
<br/>
Their ROI is the very output of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion. In other words, they are <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing and <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing for <a href="use.htm">Use</a>-Value alone.<br/>
<br/>
Ahhh, but if a 3rd person appears that does not yet have <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, we can charge him more than <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s and thereby extract <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Person #3 would not <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> if he had the <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership needed to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> him.<br/>
<br/>
If he could also gain <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, then he could become an equal peer if we <a href="use.htm">use</a> some of the <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> he paid to buy and/or <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d more Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
Treating <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er's investment creates a negative-feed<a href="back.htm">back</a> loop that auto-levels re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e allocation <small>(growth only occurs during overbidding, and overbidding only occurs when growth is truly needed)</small>, distributes control to those who are willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for it <small>(in the end those who are willing to <a href="work.htm">work</a> for it)</small>, and safely drives <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> toward 0 and allows abundance and automation without fear.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As an example, when you <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of copying an apple, which is better:<br/>
<br/>
1. An arbitrary, non-<a href="work.htm">work</a>ing group of <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers control the care <small>(they may <a href="spray.htm">spray</a> the orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> with dangerous chemicals)</small> of those <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es, and can charge a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> to <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> limited only by other competing <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
2. The <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers are the collective <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers that plant, water, maintain and harvest the fruit.&nbsp;&nbsp;They control the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es similarly to the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers in #1, but at least they can <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> themselves a higher Wage.&nbsp;&nbsp;The consumer still has little control, is not allowed to do any of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> himself, and is still at the mercy of those who <a href="own.htm">Own</a>.<br/>
<br/>
3. The perfect* <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>e where the collective <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers are the Consumers themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;They can <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e the copies themselves <small>(tend their portion of the orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> in the manner they see fit - and within the constraint of <a href="real.htm">real</a>istic divisibility)</small>, or they may hire others to <a href="work.htm">work</a> for them, but either way we <small>(the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s/consumers)</small> are in complete control.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>e also causes <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e to be the same as <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>, as <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> has no meaning when the consumer <a href="own.htm">Own</a>s the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es - or in other words, if the Consumer did <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> it, he would be <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing himself.<br/>
<br/>
<small>(*)</small>Option 3 is not achievable in a perfect or <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ic manner <small>(especially during the initial growth period)</small> because the consumer may not yet <a href="own.htm">Own</a> the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es that were <a href="use.htm">use</a>d during the round of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion that created that exact <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect, but this <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>e can always be "approached" by <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers who choose to apply an inter-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er contract that requires any <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> paid by consumers be an investment in more <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, or toward <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing-off some <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent investments, and that that those shares become the semi-divisible <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of that very same consumer."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
An initial group of potential consumers co-purchase some physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es and choose to put that <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty under a contract that requires <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers treat all <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> gained during the sale of surplus be treated as an investment from that new <a href="user.htm">user</a> toward more physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es needed to increase the scale of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
This causes growth to wax and wane according to the demand of those consumers.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e covers the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of the last round of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e may also contain dependence/desire-to-grow represented as <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> A <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>er failing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s represents a desire to shrink or sell-off that <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Abundance is goal<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Un<a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ment is not a problem<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> <a href="insur.htm">Insur</a>ance is actual<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Treating <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er's investment creates a negative-feed<a href="back.htm">back</a> loop that auto-levels re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e allocation <small>(growth only occurs during overbidding, and overbidding only occurs when growth is truly needed)</small>, distributes control to those who are willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for it <small>(in the end those who are willing to <a href="work.htm">work</a> for it)</small>, and safely drives <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> toward 0 while also creating a basis for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion withou fear of automation or un<a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> from consumers will likely be high in the early stages of development, but safely approaches zero as each gains their <a href="own.htm">own</a> percentage of <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership in the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion they need.<br/>
<br/>
A legally-binding Social Contract <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers could apply a to collective Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es so <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> would always be interpreted as <a href="user.htm">User</a> Investment whenever the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts were given, <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ed, shared, sold or <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ed.<br/>
<br/>
This inter-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er <a href="trad.htm">Trad</a>e <a href="agree.htm">Agree</a>ment should allow maximum divisibility so any <a href="user.htm">user</a> may opt-out or 'fork' their portion to treat it <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ly without needing the approval of all other <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers. For instance, let's say you have gained <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in beef cattle because you paid <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>eAbov<a href="ecos.htm">eCos</a>t for hamburgers. You may vote <small>(weighted by your % of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership)</small> on how ALL those animals are treated as a group, but if you have some special goals that few other <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers would <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> on, you can also *DIVIDE* out a <a href="real.htm">real</a>istic portion from the whole if your <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is large enough to meet the minimum granularity. So if you want your animals to be fed grass instead of grain, the granularity would be at one animal, since it is impossible to feed <a href="part.htm">part</a> of an animal one diet, and the other portion another... In another case, if you are only concerned about how the meat is <a href="pack.htm">pack</a>aged, then the granularity is much finer, and you should be able to meet those goals - though it would be your responsibility to organize that division and to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> any extra <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s <small>(such as wages)</small> required to do any extra <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Any group of <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers will dis<a href="agree.htm">agree</a> on policy over shared <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
Some types of 'contiguous' things, such as roads, sewer, water, electricity, gas lines, etc. need more logistic restrictions in their divisibility.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is an inverse measure of competition and a direct measure of monopoly. <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the portion of <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e, <a href="rent.htm">Rent</a>, Tax or Interest that goes beyond <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s. That <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> becomes usury unless it is treated as an investment from the consumer who paid it.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> should be interpreted as a plea for development because it measures consumer dependence. Usury gained against consumers disrespects their natural desire to grow, so hampers true progress.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> collected as a reward for the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers is s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>darily troublesome because it inverts the goals of that corporation from abundance and <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom toward scarcity and power.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Collective <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership as a body - in-corp-oration is the original and only valid purpose of government.<br/>
<br/>
Citizens and consumers are the same, and should be the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers for maximum performance, <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom and peace.<br/>
<br/>
Whether you call it a church, a city, a club, commons, community, company, coop, corporation, county, cult... managing collective <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty is <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult.<br/>
<br/>
Business and government are separated now only because we understanding that most businesses, especially the larger ones are somehow not fully aligned with the goals of the rest of society. It is the mistreatment of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> that inverts our original goals of peace and abundance.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers may accidentally squander their inheritance. 1st-world nations are covered with barren and even poisonous plants and mostly worthless animals - no chickens in the yards and the bees are dying.<br/>
<br/>
Originating <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers hold no special <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>us; each consumer who <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s more than <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> becomes an inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a> in Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es to <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e their <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of future <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>iculty in organizing large collective investments that stops consumers from <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ing the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion that would allow us to each have full control of the outputs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some important aspects of this Organizational Form:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Eliminates exchange of finished goods as the consumer becomes a <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Abundance and <a href="real.htm">real</a> solutions are goal and never thought 'destructive'.<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Scarcity is not sought and those physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es are <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Un<a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ment is not a problem, it is the s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>d goal.<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> <a href="work.htm">Work</a> is to be eliminated as a hurdle on the road to riches.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Low <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es are always good and tend toward <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is meaningless except as consumer growth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Entire <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion chains are finally localized.<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Development is solved instead of being sustained.<br/>

''According to Metcalfe's Law, the value of an internet connection rises with the number of <a href="user.htm">user</a>s on the <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>. However, the phone companies do not get to raise their <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es in return for that increase in value. This is a matter of considerable frustration to them.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic logic of the market suggests that capital should be invested by whoever captures the value of the investment. The telephone companies are using that argument to suggest that they should either be given monopoly <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>ing power over the last mile, or that they should be allowed to vertically integrate content with conduit. Either strategy would allow them to raise <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es by locking out the competition, thus <a href="restor.htm">restor</a>ing their coercive power over the customer and helping them extract new revenues from their internet subscribers.'' -- <a class="ext" href="http://Shirky.com/writings/zapmail.html">http://Shirky.com/writings/zapmail.html</a><br/>
