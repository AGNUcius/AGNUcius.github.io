If the humans composing our governments<br/>

issuing our <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency from the beginning<br/>
and never gone into debt AT ALL.<br/>

There is no reason for groups of people to<br/>
enter into debt when they have all the Labor<br/>

as 'taxes' to achieve their 'public' goals.<br/>
<br/>
Debt can easily avoidable by *groups* of<br/>
people if they can structure a reliable and<br/>
usable way to exchange commitments.<br/>
<br/>
By what authority do the Private <a href="bank.htm">Bank</a>sters<br/>
issue <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency, and why has almost every<br/>
city, <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e, nation on Earth relinquished<br/>
that authority?<br/>
<br/>
Do we <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly believe corporations will have<br/>
incentives to not over-issue?<br/>
<br/>
They don't even *print* the <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y anyway,<br/>
they only *issue* it electronically.<br/>
<br/>
Issuance is a matter of holding down the 0-<br/>

Gaaarrrr!&nbsp;&nbsp;The lack of careful thought and<br/>
r<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>sideration of why we our drowning in<br/>

<br/>
But when someone has insufficient <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es, they<br/>
will need to buy those <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts from someone else,<br/>
and so we can sell Surplus <small>(whatever we don't <a href="use.htm">use</a><br/>

We can collect <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> from those non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, but<br/>
to inhibit control concentration, we enforce a<br/>

They may appear similar on the surface, but the<br/>
internal <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erences cause cooperatives to slowly<br/>
suffer nearly the same fate as most every for-<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> organization, governments of every size,<br/>

community or whatever <a href="title.htm">title</a> you give <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
The problem of Capital Accumulation occurs in a<br/>
incremental and stepwise fashion that is easy for<br/>
us to lose track where the problem originates.<br/>
<br/>
But if we "step-through" <small>(as a programmer debugging<br/>
a re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e allocation routine)</small> the problem at a<br/>
slower pace to fully analyze each transaction, we<br/>
can see it is the <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> that causes Growth<br/>
to be "worth it" <small>(the <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er covers all previously<br/>
paid <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s AND usually <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> <small>(<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above<br/>
<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
And so treating <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as an investment from that<br/>
<a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er causes control, through <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership, to be<br/>
autodistributed to those willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for it.<br/>
<br/>
Whereas, in a typical organization, the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers treat <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> many other ways that do not<br/>
solve the problem from a 'Systems' perspective.<br/>
<br/>
Treating <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er Investment is very much<br/>
like directing some a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of steam from a steam-<br/>
engine toward a 'governor' <small>(a sensor and valve)</small><br/>
so that pressure cannot grow beyond safety.<br/>
<br/>
Probably the most important <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence is that<br/>
<a href="imput.htm">Imput</a>ed <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion *eliminates* the need to<br/>
<a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects and in doing so, *eliminates* <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Eliminating the <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e of <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects also eliminates<br/>
one of our reasons we believe we must <a href="pass.htm">pass</a> tokens.<br/>
<br/>
Eliminating Wages is accomplished when <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers<br/>
commit to <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e labor in the future for the return<br/>
of other people committing other <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s toward<br/>

Hello Tobias,<br/>
<br/>
I am very interested in a sub-<a href="part.htm">part</a> of this problem<br/>
for which I don't see much discussion, and so would<br/>
ask forgiveness if this is outside the scope of the<br/>
/open project...<br/>
<br/>
The subject has to do with the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of *hosting*<br/>
data that we want to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e 'open'.<br/>
<br/>
My thinking revolves around the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a that, while<br/>
corporations like Google and Facebook are able to<br/>
cover their <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of hosting AND to also <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>,<br/>
while we, as purveyors of <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom, cannot seem to<br/>
cover even the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of hosting - and so lack even<br/>
the most basic <a href="file.htm">file</a> <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age or e<a href="mail.htm">mail</a> services.<br/>
<br/>
I have some <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>as about why this is not yet done<br/>
and some <a href="part.htm">part</a>ial approaches to solving the issue,<br/>
but will wait to be sure you are interested.<br/>

This is sufficient for the perfect case - where the Consumers <a href="own.htm">own</a> *exactly* enough <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <small>(for example a milk dairy)</small> to create *exactly* enough <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t <small>(milk, butter, cheese, etc.)</small>.<br/>

When there is surplus, we could sell it to those outside the Crowd, and could likely sell it for more than the <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, meaning we would '<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>'.<br/>

<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> measures <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty mis-allocation, and is *eliminated* when the Consumers <a href="own.htm">own</a> the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of the things they need.<br/>
<br/>
We should treat <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as an Investment from late <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>ers so they incrementally become <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers in *new* <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers would buy <small>(<a href="land.htm">land</a>, water rights, etc.)</small> to grow the corporation.<br/>

The presence of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> within an <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic<br/>
system indicates <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty mis-allocation.<br/>
<br/>
This reasoning is based on the observation<br/>
that <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is *undefined* when <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t is<br/>
treated as ROI.&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, if a group<br/>
of consumers <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion<br/>
for some Good or Service <small>(say a nut orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a>)</small>,<br/>
and if they accept the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t itself as the<br/>
Return for those Investments, then there is<br/>
no Sale <small>(each <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>er of the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <a href="own.htm">own</a>s<br/>
the same % of the Outputs)</small>, and so there is<br/>
no chance for <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> because the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t is<br/>
not bought or Sold - it is already the <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty<br/>
of those who will finally consume it.<br/>
<br/>
This solves the '<a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ic' case, where the<br/>
consumers <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> *exactly* as much <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es<br/>
needed to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e that which they need.<br/>
<br/>
The 'dynamic' case <small>(where surplus is sold<br/>
to non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers)</small> requires a negative-feed<a href="back.htm">back</a><br/>
loop -- think of it as a Growth Thermo<a href="stat.htm">stat</a><br/>
that auto-distributes <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership to<br/>
those willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <small>(and ultimately <a href="work.htm">work</a><br/>
for that growth)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> collected when selling surplus to<br/>
non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers must be 'reflected' <a href="back.htm">back</a> to the<br/>

<br/>
Treating <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er Investment in more<br/>
<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es causes those late-comers to gain<br/>
<a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership in their <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="part.htm">part</a> of that<br/>

Oooh, nice analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;This helps me see more of the changes under this <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty arrangement.<br/>

But there still seems to be a problem with your original claim <small>(the origin of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is <a href="hard.htm">hard</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a>)</small> if we introduce further constraints:<br/>
<br/>
For example, if ALL milk-drinkers in the region were the <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers of dairies for their <a href="own.htm">own</a> benefit, then there wouldn't be a market value <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> from <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s - and so all <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> would be missing for that <a href="part.htm">part</a>icular <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t <small>(nobody would ever buy milk again, but would instead only be <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
This is true of any industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine we, the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s, were to buy and <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> a cellular <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> for our <a href="own.htm">own</a> good.<br/>
<br/>
We would have to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of operation, but could not <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> called 'earnings' by the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers - all of that value would be 'savings' for us as something we would not <small>(and even could not)</small> <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> - for who would we <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> it to?<br/>

<a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>s = Customer_<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e - <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s<br/>
<br/>
But I still don't understand *where* <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> comes from.<br/>
<br/>
If the answer is "from <a href="hard.htm">hard</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a>", then why does it disappear when the Customers <a href="own.htm">own</a> the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion and treat <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t as ROI?<br/>
<br/>
Does this mean less <a href="work.htm">work</a> is being done under those <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty arrangements?&nbsp;&nbsp;That seems unlikely.<br/>
<br/>
If those same Customers were NOT the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion, then most likely they would have paid <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> to those <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't seem to have anything to do with how much <a href="work.htm">work</a> is being done - for it is the same is both cases.<br/>
<br/>
Valor P. <span class="quot2">>>That's when it becomes a "public good" and the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is called a tax instead.</span><br/>

<br/>
Are you saying gov <a href="job.htm">job</a>s are not "<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a>"?<br/>
<br/>
When a corporation has few or no <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s to report, does that mean the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers were lazy?<br/>
<br/>
I don't think "<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a>" is the origin of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.<br/>

Hmm...&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you talking about *hosting* some of these applications<br/>
in a semi-centralized maybe even <a href="cloud.htm">cloud</a>-like fashion?<br/>
<br/>
If so, then count me in!&nbsp;&nbsp;We MUST learn to share <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ware to be<br/>
able to compete head-to-head against the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent offerings.<br/>
<br/>
In the end we, the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s, must <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> all physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es required<br/>
for this kind of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, including all copper wires, all fiber, all<br/>
poles, all ISPs, all cell-phone towers and supporting equipment, all<br/>
satellites, all under-sea communications, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Until we have <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership, we cannot have full <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom.<br/>
