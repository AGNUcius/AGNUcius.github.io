<br/>
Yes, why is the "materiality of the <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual" so vehemently denied?<br/>
<br/>
Why do so many claim the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>ing and delivering Software,<br/>

The Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es required to host these <a href="virt.htm">Virt</a>ual <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es are<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span>massive* for corporations such as Google, Facebook, etc.<br/>
<br/>
This problem is *NO <a href="diff.htm">DIFF</a>E<a href="rent.htm">RENT</a>* from the ancient problem of <a href="land.htm">Land</a><br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership for the purpose of basic subsistence.<br/>
We must learn to <a href="work.htm">work</a> together.&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot overgrow the Capitalists in<br/>
solitary confinement.<br/>
<br/>
But instead of facing the problem of co-owing Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es, we are<br/>
told by Eben Moglen, Ric<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> <a href="stallman.htm">Stallman</a> and many others that each of us<br/>
must <a href="own.htm">own</a> these things in *absolute isolation* to retain <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom.<br/>
<br/>
The Open Manufacturers are also in denial; they focus solely upon<br/>
design and *individual* <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of manufacturing plants <small>(RepRap,<br/>
etc.)</small>,<br/>
even though the original manufacturing plants <small>(organisms that create<br/>
food, medicine, <a href="soap.htm">soap</a>s, etc.)</small> have been forever available for<br/>
individual <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership <small>(gardening)</small><br/>
<br/>
Individual, isolated <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership *DOES NOT <a href="work.htm">WORK</a>* because we are then<br/>
each forced to have the extreme <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s needed to operate and deal with<br/>
the outputs of those Servers, Robots or Organisms which is far more<br/>
time and labor intensive as compared to the efficiency of scale the<br/>
Capitalists enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, some Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es are *meaningless* when <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed in isolation.<br/>
<br/>
For example, We, the <a href="user.htm">User</a>s, will need collectively purchase and/or<br/>
<a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d and then <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> the material infrastructure that our ISPs and<br/>
Cell-Phone providers hold against us before we can finally have any<br/>
<a href="real.htm">real</a> say in how those <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>s are governed.<br/>
<br/>
Once we see that <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership can be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d as a force for good,<br/>
we can then begin to co-buy our way out of subjection.<br/>
<br/>
But such an organization will be very unstable unless we are able to<br/>
admit the true origin and purpose of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, for otherwise the<br/>
originators of such a facility will surely treat that <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a><br/>
as a reward for themselves - which will concentrate power and<br/>
eventually cause the group to be no <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> from any other<br/>
Capitalist endeavor.<br/>

<br/>
How strange that we have forgotten the value of investing for <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span>directly*.<br/>
<br/>
We *can* have a "Basic Outcome" by co-owing the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion<br/>
needed for those solutions instead of holding those solutions against<br/>
our collective selves in the bizarre pursuit of keeping <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above<br/>
<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>...<br/>
<br/>
<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine how cheap housing would be if we *actually* <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ed the <a href="land.htm">land</a><br/>

<br/>
<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine how cheap food would be if we <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ed the farms together and<br/>
received the food itself as the ROI for the risk we take.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Grouping together can be valuable even if not purchasing the final <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
For example, <a href="imag.htm">imag</a>ine a neighborhood of say 1000 people <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> a<br/>
Business-Class internet connection from an ISP in the area.<br/>
<br/>
Let's say the <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e the ISP charges is $500/month.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly all these co-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ers have high-speed internet in the US for<br/>
just $2/month!<br/>
<br/>
We can do this with any and all industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine a Consumer <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ed<br/>
cell-phone <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
We would only charge ourselves *exactly* what it <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s to send a txt<br/>
message or a photograph, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Why do we not do this?<br/>
<br/>
This is important for Open Manufacturing, because many <a href="mac.htm">Mac</a>hines are<br/>
still too expensive to be <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by just one person at a time.<br/>
<br/>
We need to learn how to <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> for our <a href="own.htm">OWN</a> benefit.<br/>

This is a rephrasing of the concept of "<a href="land.htm">Land</a> Tax" or "Single Tax" or<br/>
"Community <a href="rent.htm">Rent</a>" as <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>osed by Henry George and many other <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic<br/>

<br/>
The primary problem with the way most cities handle "<a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty Tax" is<br/>
that they allow the very rich to hold <a href="land.htm">land</a> idle in *speculation* of<br/>
returns - causing <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es to rise and forms the basis of sprawl.<br/>
<br/>
So "<a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty Tax", as it is now, is a terrible <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el for us to<br/>
<a href="emu.htm">emu</a>late, as it would have us punish those that improve their lots,<br/>

Are you talking about some sort of "bare minimum" standard-of-<a href="liv.htm">liv</a>ing,<br/>

<br/>
<span class="quot">> look at how asymmetric contribution is handled.</span><br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> I must not be thinking about this correctly, though.</span><br/>
<br/>
The question is more simple than I explained.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is more like:<br/>
<br/>
"What is the optimum* way to Tax* the Citizens*?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<small>(*Optimum)</small> meaning: Highest standard of <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>ing at the lowest overall<br/>

The fact there was a conflict *proves* there were insufficient<br/>
resouces to meet peak Demand.<br/>
<br/>
The winning bidder will <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> a <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> <small>(<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>)</small> to the Group.<br/>
<br/>
The fact that the are willing and able to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> *proves* they<br/>
need more <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But if nobody in the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent Group is selling any shares, then the<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is <a href="use.htm">use</a>d toward purchasing yet *another* tiller.<br/>
<br/>
Let's say the winning bidder paid so much that he <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ed 1% of a new tiller!<br/>
<br/>
Who should be the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of that 1%?&nbsp;&nbsp;Who should control that new tiller?<br/>
<br/>
It seems clear to me the the new <a href="own.htm">own</a>er should be he who Paid.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t Futures</span><br/>
It seems the Groups could issue a sort of "<a href="use.htm">Use</a> Ticket" or<br/>
"Pre-<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion Bond" I've been thinking of as a "<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t Future".<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a is to print <small>(though eventually electronic)</small> booklets<br/>
containing representations of the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts expected from this<br/>
investment.<br/>
<br/>
For example, in the case of a tiller, the Tickets might say "Good for<br/>
1 Hour <a href="rent.htm">Rent</a>al".<br/>
<br/>
In the scenario above, where there are 365 equal <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers, each<br/>
<a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>er would receive a booklet of 24 such Tickets.<br/>
<br/>
These tickets can also be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d during Auction.<br/>

<br/>
"What!?" you say, "How can you possibly <a href="use.htm">use</a> something as vicious and<br/>
terrible as Private <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty in a 'good' manner?".<br/>
<br/>
The secret lies in how the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> <a href="use.htm">use</a>s Copyright against itself as Copy<a href="left.htm">left</a>.<br/>
We can <a href="use.htm">use</a> the same pattern in the physical <a href="real.htm">real</a>m as, well, as "<a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty <a href="left.htm">Left</a>".<br/>
<br/>
"<a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty <a href="left.htm">Left</a>" will be a legally-binding document enforcing Social<br/>

We then organize to co-purchase <a href="land.htm">Land</a> and Tools that we will place<br/>
under this compact.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Origin and Purpose of Growth</span><br/>
By doing this we give ourselves the opportunity to "do the right<br/>
thing" with <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
But before we can write such a Private Law we will need to understand how groups<br/>
gain <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <small>(how they grow)</small>, and *WHO* should control that new <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
Growth occurs when <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e is kept above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
So <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is a very important <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e of Growth.<br/>
<br/>
But what is <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>?&nbsp;&nbsp;Where does it come from?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Origin and Purpose of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a></span><br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> indicates a <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er's lack of <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
When he who eats the fruit is the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er of the tree, then only <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s are paid.<br/>
There is no <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> because there is no Purchase, for the eater <a href="own.htm">own</a>s it already.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This collapses the complexity of exchange down to <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ing only <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s.<br/>
Customers pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for Goods and Services to become <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
Those with <a href="skill.htm">Skill</a> can <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> with <a href="work.htm">Work</a> if what they offer is wanted in the <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>

more <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
So growth and clustering is possible, but occurs in an auto-distributed manner.<br/>

Through this binding agent we can enforce a bare-minimum set of<br/>
requirements for Allocation and Scheduling of re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es we hold in<br/>
'common'.<br/>
<br/>
It will be a sort of 'Simulated Commons' in that we are explicitly<br/>
using <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership to <a href="part.htm">part</a>ition the earth into small chunks that<br/>
we collectively purchase for our <a href="own.htm">own</a> benefit.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h4">====Example</span><br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> A large group co-buys <small>(crowd-<a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s)</small> a parcel of <a href="land.htm">land</a>.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> The <a href="land.htm">land</a> is held in perpetuity by a Trust or non-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a><br/>

that can be chosen from)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
3.)</small> The Trust *must* either qualify as a non-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> entity or move<br/>
outside of city-limits to escape city <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty taxes that will<br/>
otherwise punish all improvements.<br/>
<br/>
4.)</small> Doing this will '<a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ualize' access to the <a href="land.htm">Land</a> - allowing<br/>
individuals and corporations to Lease <a href="part.htm">part</a>s of the whole, but never<br/>
able to sell any <a href="part.htm">part</a>.<br/>
<br/>
5.)</small> The most important point of this is the structure of those Leases<br/>
- which can be thought-of as a sort of internal <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty tax - and how<br/>
they must weigh against *holdings* instead of weighing against<br/>
improvements.<br/>
<br/>
The concept of "<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er Investment" still applies, and means<br/>
"Whenever the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of a Lease is more than needed to cover <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s,<br/>
that overpayment becomes the <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er's <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership in the Trust.<br/>
<br/>
6.)</small> I'm still uncertain if this is sufficient.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've always <a href="imag.htm">imag</a>ined<br/>
whatever Social Compact we design must also apply to movable <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ed<br/>
Capital <small>(tools and such)</small>, but am trying to get away from that<br/>
approach, mostly because it is so <a href="hard.htm">hard</a> to 'police' and 'enforce'.<br/>

So we, as groups of groups, can avoid using debt-based <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency within<br/>

Most scarcity is constructed because we misunderstand the meaning and purpose of<br/>
<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>, and so are driven to scarcify in the name of RETURN.<br/>
<br/>
For example, <a href="imag.htm">imag</a>ine we both Invest in Agriculture in the 'normal',<br/>
Capitalistic manner.<br/>
<br/>
We call-up some sort of "<a href="fund.htm">Fund</a>s Agent" of some sort <small>(I actually don't<br/>
<a href="know.htm">know</a> how that <a href="part.htm">part</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a>s)</small>, and he then sells us some "Mutual <a href="fund.htm">Fund</a>s" in<br/>
the Industrialized Farming and High-Density Animal Feed-Lots.<br/>
<br/>
The RETURN we have been programmed to expect requires the finished<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts be sold at a <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
But as the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of Agricultural <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts nears /sufficiency/, <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e<br/>
approaches <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>, endangering our Investments!<br/>
<br/>
So we can easily see that treating <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> as a RETURN<br/>
creates the homicidal incentive to construct **<a href="art.htm">Art</a>ificial Scarcity**.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The flaw in our <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic system is our misunderstanding and<br/>
mistreatment of the late-comer who is in a bind and has no <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
One approach to solve this is:<br/>
<br/>
0.)</small> Attract large numbers of potential Customers to Invest and <a href="own.htm">Own</a> the<br/>
<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> Reward those Inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s with <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their RETURN is the<br/>
finished Good or Service.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> Whenever there is more <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts than the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers can <a href="use.htm">use</a><br/>
for themselves, Sell the Surplus to non-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers for a <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
3.)</small> Treat any collected <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> as an Investment from that <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er.<br/>

I am <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing on an <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a for Civilization <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>eling <small>(such as those<br/>
covered by "Journal of <a href="art.htm">Art</a>ificial Societies and Social Simulation"<br/>
<small>[<a class="ext" href="http://JASSS.SOC.Surrey.ac.uk">JASSS.SOC.Surrey.ac.uk</a>]</small>)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the simulated environment I envision, <a href="user.htm">user</a>s could interact with<br/>
the system in 2 possible ways:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> As 'Agents' in the simulation <small>(there would be no <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial<br/>
Agents)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This would initially be about the same as a <a href="free.htm">free</a>-form <a href="3d.htm">3D</a><br/>
Chat system, but one where your Agent must eat, drink, sleep, excrete,<br/>
etc., and via for <a href="land.htm">Land</a> and Capital to accomplish those goals.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> <a href="user.htm">User</a>s can submit a sort of "Constitution" or "Laws" or "Terms of<br/>
Operation" that they <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ose other Agents apply to their <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ed<br/>
<a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.&nbsp;&nbsp;If these documents are written in a very high-level<br/>
language <small>(VHLL)</small>, we could eventually understand enough to apply them<br/>
to simple <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial Agents and then be able to watch how <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a><br/>
<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>osals shape the way we organize.<br/>

This cannot be a one-time tactic limited to the initial <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipants, but must be a legally binding "Terms of Operation" to which that group will commit.<br/>
<br/>
Our growth strategy must addresses the disadvantage of the late-comer <small>(the customer)</small> while <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ing those who have already paid their dues.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is <a href="part.htm">part</a>ially a matter of defining borders.<br/>
<br/>
This will allow us to grow while avoiding the otherwise inevitible demise of most all orgs = overaccumulation and from that, a centralization of power.<br/>
<br/>

<span class="quot">> There needs to be a shift in the way that existing financiers see their</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> role.</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let us consider a shift away from seeing <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as a "reward to be won" toward understanding <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is a measure of that late-comer's "dependency" upon the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
If we attract Consumers as micro-Inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s who pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts they need, then we can <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> them in <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t instead.<br/>
<br/>
Then, whenever a late-comer does not have sufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, we will allow him to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>, but then treat that overpayment as that <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er's Investment.<br/>
<br/>
In this way the group can grow <small>(buying more <a href="land.htm">Land</a> and Capital)</small> using those <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>s, but the <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership of those new assets accrues to the original <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er instead of being fattening the wallets or control of those who already have sufficient <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership.<br/>

<br/>
Sharing can be valuable, but we cannot share in a sustainable manner unless we cover all of our operational <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe we could devise a type of collective <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership that addresses this issue.<br/>
<br/>
For example, co-owing <a href="mak.htm">Mak</a>erBots and RepRaps would allow us to increase utilization nearer to maximum.&nbsp;&nbsp;This would aleviate some of the environmental issues <a href="real.htm">Real</a>CleverName mentions.<br/>
<br/>
If 1 person <a href="own.htm">own</a>s such a <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine, he can only <a href="use.htm">use</a> it as much as he can remain awake each day.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a *guaranteed* a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of down-time where the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine is sitting idle because he must at least sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is inefficient.<br/>
<br/>
If 2 people were to <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> a <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine, they could each <a href="use.htm">use</a> it 12 hrs per day, and so utilization could be maximized.<br/>
<br/>
But probably most people are not interested in using such a <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine 12 hours every day in perpetuity.&nbsp;&nbsp;So many groups could be much larger.<br/>
<br/>
So increasing the number of <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers lower the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s for each <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>er until utilization reaches maximum - for then the extra <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers become a scheduling burden for the group.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A major problem with sharing is that it doesn't seem to 'scale' to any appreciable degree.<br/>
<br/>
A group <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ing a single <a href="mak.htm">Mak</a>erBot might decide to "open it up" to others who want that experience.<br/>
<br/>
But they can't just let people <a href="use.htm">use</a> it for <a href="free.htm">free</a>, for how will the group fix the extra wear and damage?<br/>
<br/>
So the group must charge some a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of '<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>' to cover those <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s or they must inflict such limits as to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e the claim of openness seem false.<br/>
<br/>
Surprisingly, the new <a href="user.htm">user</a>s who are not <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership group are likely willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> even more than <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
So it is a common case that groups can 'earn' the special value called '<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>' which is generally treated as some sort of reward for the group which they can <a href="use.htm">use</a> to grow the organization <small>(they could by even more <a href="mak.htm">Mak</a>erBots)</small> or whatever they want, but the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er recieves none of that.<br/>
<br/>
It is this misunderstanding of the origin and purpose of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> that causes almost every organization <small>(every group)</small> to fail when they attempt to scale, for they suddenly <a href="real.htm">real</a>ize all the value has been concentrated into the hands of the few <small>(usually the originators)</small>, and so begins to operate as all other 'regular' businesses.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is actually a somewhat good thing in that it is the basis of growth.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is a "Growth Vector" with both size and direction.<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> The size is determined by the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er's 'dependency' on the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers <small>(or you might say "because of the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er's lack of <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership")</small>.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> The direction is determined by the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers which <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es it easy to see why they point it at themselves.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The solution is to point that value <a href="back.htm">back</a> at the <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er...&nbsp;&nbsp;But not just handing it <a href="back.htm">back</a> to him as <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e-break, but by investing it *for* him, with his receiving <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in a sort of 'delayed' manner to stop him from immediately selling it and thereby comprimising his future <small>(this is sort of brute-force, there is probably a better way of solving this issue)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Treating <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er Investment creates a "negative feed<a href="back.htm">back</a> loop" which stablizes the system since <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is UNDEFINED when the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er is the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ective Consumer - for the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of an Apple tree does not buy the fruit from himself, but <a href="own.htm">own</a>s it already as a side-effect of his <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine an 'auction' setting where non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ing <a href="user.htm">user</a>s bid to <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine at <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> time slots.<br/>
<br/>
In the case where only one person wants the time slot, the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine is <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ed "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>".<br/>
<br/>
When more than one <a href="user.htm">user</a> wants a specific time slot, the auction begins.&nbsp;&nbsp;The winning bidder will have paid <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> <small>(<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>)</small>, which proves the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ware is insufficient to meet peak demand and also proves the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er is willing to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e that investment.<br/>
<br/>
So when a non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ing <a href="user.htm">user</a> <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>s the <a href="mak.htm">Mak</a>erBot for a <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>, the group should allow that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment, but should then queue that <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y toward being invested in yet *another* <a href="mak.htm">Mak</a>erBot instance that the <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er will eventually <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> with other non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers who also <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
This creates a sort of 'conduit' structure where the original Group can safely <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> their equipment to others because they charge enough to cover <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s, while any further <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> collected during auction is <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to grow yet *another* Group that, when finally formed, can safely 'fork' from the other Group and <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e their <a href="own.htm">own</a> choices about how to treat *their* new equipment.<br/>

<br/>
We are trying to push the horse with the cart.<br/>
<br/>
Increasing Wages is a well meaning but wrong-headed approach.<br/>
<br/>
We can safely decrease <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e to <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> if our Inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s are also Consumers - for we will <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> them with <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t instead.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine groups of Consumers collectively purchase some <a href="land.htm">Land</a> and Capital to begin <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of keeping <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>, each person wanting Olive Oil <small>(for instance)</small> would strive to <a href="own.htm">own</a> sufficient Olive Oil <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <small>(the tree, <a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e, water, tools, etc. needed to host that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
They need not necessarily be a <a href="work.htm">Work</a>er in that field, but only to '<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>' all the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion - with Wages being one of those <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
When the Consumer is the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er, he <a href="own.htm">own</a>s the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ective already, even before it has been <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed.<br/>
<br/>
This means the Consumer receives the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t at <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> - but even more <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>amentally, it changes the <a href="game.htm">game</a> from one of perpetuating <a href="work.htm">work</a> to one of eliminating such tedium.<br/>
