<a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty and Contract in <a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omics: The Case for <a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omic Democracy.<br/>
<br/>
Out of print with rights reverted to the author.<br/>
<br/>
This book presents a <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern version of the old Labor <small>(or Natural Rights)</small> Theory of <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty and of an Inalienable Rights Theory that descends from the Reformation and Enlightenment. Together these theories re-solve the basic problem of distribution in the sense of giving a basis for the just ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riation of <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty and a basis for answering the question of who is to be the firm, e.g., the suppliers of share capital as in conventional capital, the government as in socialism, or the people who <a href="work.htm">work</a> in the firm as in the system of <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic democracy <small>(or labor-managed market <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omies)</small>. While these theories address old questions in <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omics, they do so in an entirely <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> manner than conventional <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omics which renders the questions as being about value or <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e theory <small>(instead of about <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty rights and contracts)</small>. This book is now out of print and the rights have reverted to the author. A neo-Austrian pre-publication reviewer of the book described the book as follows:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The book's radical re-interpretation of <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty and contract is, I think, among the most powerful critiques of mainstream <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omics ever developed. It undermines the neoclassical way of thinking about <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty by <a href="art.htm">art</a>iculating a theory of inalienable rights, and constructs out of this perspective a "labor theory of <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty" which is as <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> from Marx's labor theory of value as it is from neoclassicism. It traces roots of such <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>as in some fascinating and largely forgotten strands of the hi<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>y of <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omics. It draws attention to the question of "responsibility" which neoclassicism has utterly lost sight of. It is <a href="start.htm">start</a>lingly fresh in its overall approach, and unusually well written in its presentation.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>.. It constitutes a better case for its <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic democracy viewpoint than anything else in the literature."<br/>

The lesson I draw from the experience of eastern Europe was that it was<br/>
a mistake in countries like Po<a href="land.htm">land</a> not to let consumer goods <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es<br/>
follow values. Attempts to subsidise consumer goods led to shortages and<br/>
suppressed inflation. So I think you need a consumer goods market of the<br/>
sort advocated in the 1930s by Lange and Dickinson, where goods are sold<br/>
at market clearing <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="stock.htm">Stock</a> control data from this process, along with the ratio between the<br/>
selling <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e and the labour content of goods would then be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d by a<br/>
cybernetic system to adjust output levels of goods.<br/>
<br/>
Since, however, the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion would be communal, the units of<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion would not depend on selling commodities for their survival in<br/>
the capitalist sense. The unit of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion would not <a href="own.htm">own</a> the goods it<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed, they would be commonly <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed and the individual consumer would<br/>
purchase them from the community by the performance of an equivalent<br/>
a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of labour to that contained in the goods, with some system of<br/>
electronic accounting keeping track of the labour each person performs<br/>
and indirectly consumes.<br/>
<br/>
The consumer would have the right to purchase consumer goods from<br/>
community shops. The units of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion would not be subjects of right<br/>
like capitalist firms. They would not sell the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts, just as&nbsp;&nbsp;the<br/>
coke <a href="work.htm">work</a>s in a steel mill today does not sell the coke to the blast<br/>
furnace division, it simply delivers it as <a href="part.htm">part</a> of an integrated<br/>
process.<br/>

<span class="quot">> I do not think there will ever be more successful market players</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> but capitalist corporations.</span><br/>
<br/>
Capitalism happens to be winning now, but we <a href="know.htm">know</a> it is very inefficient.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">>But since the 18</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> years I am on that track, I have not found one corporation that did more</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> than lip service to this market <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If we ever determined the mechanical 'error' in Capitalism that causes problems we see, couldn't we <a href="start.htm">start</a> a corporation for ourselves that has some sort of "Terms of Operation" - a contract that constrains <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e in a manner similar maybe to the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The pattern of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> is:<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span> <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers choose to apply some constraints to the <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e of their <a href="own.htm">OWN</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span> One constraint requires any seller <small>(or giver)</small> must <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e the new consumer <small>(<a href="user.htm">user</a>)</small> gains "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" access the capital <small>(<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es)</small> of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
The consumer can slowly gain "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" access <small>(<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership)</small> to the Capital required for physical <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion if "<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" <small>(<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> is treated as an investment from the consumer who paid it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I may be right or wrong about the shape of the contract, but either way couldn't a contract we choose to apply to a corporation we begin ourselves hold those <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>als in place?<br/>
<br/>
Whatever constraint we find to be ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riate, let's write a contract that can be applied to the physical aspects of all things <small>(all things are simply design applied to mass)</small> so that we can begin a corporation under those Terms of Operation and finally begin to outcooperate the inefficient Capitalists.<br/>

I do not <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> with the assertion that every player <small>(every human on earth?)</small> must follow the destructive goal of "<a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing more <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y from invested <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y".<br/>
<br/>
There are many micro-<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omies <small>(such as in families or maybe in some small communes)</small> where action is taken <small>(<a href="work.htm">work</a>)</small> for the sole purpose of <a href="produc.htm">PRODUC</a>T, not for <a href="profit.htm">PROFIT</a>.<br/>
<br/>

I don't understand.&nbsp;&nbsp;If no player <small>(human)</small> can ever possibly do anything beyond being a Capitalist pawn, then shouldn't we just give up now?<br/>
