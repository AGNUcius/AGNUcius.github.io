<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership has a surprising effect on <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
When the consumer of an <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect <a href="own.htm">own</a>s the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of that<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, then he must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of that operation.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if you <a href="own.htm">own</a> a <a href="back.htm">back</a>hoe, then you must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s to<br/>
operate and maintain and <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>e the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine.&nbsp;&nbsp;You must grease it, add<br/>
oil and diesel, check the water, etc.<br/>
<br/>
If you hire people to do those <a href="job.htm">job</a>s, then you will need to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> those<br/>
wages <small>(as a <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
You must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all of the same <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s as any other <a href="own.htm">own</a>er, but the one<br/>
thing you don't <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> is <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> - for who would you <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> it to?<br/>
<br/>
So <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> = 0 when the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es is the consumer of those<br/>
<a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ectives because there is nobody else to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> I'm not sure that I understand the overall utility of ever 'lowering' the</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e to 3.75 since this points at some kind of 'stable' system,</span><br/>
<br/>
A strange feature of <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect <a href="user.htm">user</a>s being <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers is that <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e<br/>
approaches <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> on it's <a href="own.htm">own</a>!<br/>
<br/>
I'm not suggesting we lower <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificially.&nbsp;&nbsp;We should charge<br/>
just a little less than the "going rate" in the area.<br/>
<br/>
But we won't be able to stop <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> from approaching zero for any <a href="user.htm">user</a><br/>
gaining <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es - because the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es is also<br/>
the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects even before they are even <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed!<br/>
<br/>
For example: One <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ective of a <a href="back.htm">back</a>hoe is to create big holes in the<br/>
ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you, as <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er, <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for that <a href="back.htm">back</a>hoe to be<br/>
operated, you <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> only the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody is lowering the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e for<br/>
that <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ective; <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e==<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> as a *side effect* of your <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in<br/>
the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
If you <a href="own.htm">own</a> a cow, then you don't buy the milk from yourself, you only<br/>
<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
If you <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> some cows, you don't buy the milk from yourselves, you<br/>
only <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
If you <a href="own.htm">own</a> a dairy with 999 other people, then you must each <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> your<br/>
portion of the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s, but you wouldn't need to buy the milk from your<br/>
collective 'self', but would each already <a href="own.htm">own</a> the same % of milk as<br/>
you <a href="own.htm">own</a> cattle.<br/>
<br/>
You could also eventually also have <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in equipment to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e<br/>
butter, ice cream, cheese, etc. - and would then <a href="own.htm">own</a> those <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ectives<br/>
"at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" as well.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> To go further, which <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, how deep into the supply chain, and for how</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> long <small>(1 year or perpeuity)</small> are the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es secured?</span><br/>
<br/>
You, as the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>, should ultimately gain <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership in<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span>all* of the means of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion for as deep as those chains run.<br/>
<br/>
You, as the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, should have the option to sell<br/>
immediately or to keep <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership for any length of time.<br/>
<br/>
Under the Terms of Operation outlined, if you sell or <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e any<br/>
<a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ectives <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed by those <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ed <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, then you would be<br/>
required to treat all <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> charged against that purchaser<br/>
as their investment in more <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
A significant side-effect of treating <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> in this manner is that<br/>
<a href="part.htm">part</a>icipants will tend to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for only about as much as they need for<br/>
themselves and so there will not be much of a problem with<br/>
overaccumulation.<br/>

I'm afraid they are all wrong in their <a href="own.htm">own</a> ways.<br/>
<br/>
More from ignorance than maliciousness, ALL of our attempts to<br/>
organize have failed to provide even our *basic* necessities.<br/>
<br/>
How could so many people be homeless and hungry when there is far, far<br/>
more than enough <a href="land.htm">land</a> and water needed to do so?<br/>
<br/>
If our planet was much smaller <small>(or think of an is<a href="land.htm">land</a>)</small>, and if there<br/>
<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ortionally fewer humans, would more than half of the inhabitants<br/>
be without clean water, food and shelter?<br/>
<br/>
Would we, as is<a href="land.htm">land</a>ers, also construct famine <small>(as the US Farm Bill<br/>
does)</small> by <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing each other to NOT grow food - so that <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es are kept<br/>
above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>?<br/>
<br/>
We are *terrible* at organization.<br/>
<br/>
Once a person or group decides to organize, they immediately take a<br/>
stance against all the people who will <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for the growth of that<br/>
entity in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Those who organize don't understand what <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> measures, and so treat<br/>
it as some sort of reward - as though they should celebrate the<br/>
depravity and dependence that is the basis and only reason a consumer<br/>
would <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
We, as a species, should be 'setup' by now.<br/>
<br/>
Sure there is still <a href="work.htm">work</a> to do, but why are most of us <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing almost<br/>
non-stop for just the absolute bare essentials?<br/>
<br/>
Why do we <a href="work.htm">work</a> our entire <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>es and *still* not even <a href="own.htm">own</a> a house?<br/>
<br/>
We must organize for the benefit of those willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for the <a href="real.htm">real</a><br/>
<a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and for those who <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for the expansion of that<br/>
entity.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the consumer in both cases.<br/>
<br/>

<span class="quot">> If the argument is against <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as reward, you will lose.</span><br/>
<br/>
I'm not petitioning a government.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't have enough Federal Reserve<br/>
<a href="note.htm">Note</a>s to purchase such legislation.<br/>
<br/>
We don't need to beg the actors in the theatre called 'government'.<br/>
They won't and even *can't* help us because for-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> corporations<br/>
are the only ones <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently getting anything done!<br/>
<br/>
We can solve this by organizing for ourselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;We could do this as a<br/>
Corporation, but that isn't strictly necessary.<br/>
<br/>
That organization must be operated under a special Terms of Operation<br/>
that designates the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a> treatment of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as a <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er's<br/>
investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;That organization will then grow and cause Capitalist to<br/>
become unimportant.<br/>
<br/>
Such an organization is certain to outcompete all others since it will<br/>
not be required to keep <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <small>(inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s as consumers are<br/>
paid in <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, not <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
We should probably allow <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es to float close to what the "market<br/>
will bear", but only for the purpose of helping those latecoming<br/>
<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ers to gain <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership in the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es needed for that<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
As <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es approach <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s, our organization will not fail or even be<br/>
concerned, since that only indicates that those <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipants are<br/>
gaining sufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion as they<br/>
should.<br/>
<br/>
We can easily endure a lack of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> should be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d for<br/>
growth, and when that growth is <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by those who need the outputs<br/>
thereof, then <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is naturally reduced.<br/>
<br/>
When <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> reaches zero, it will be time for celebration, not for<br/>
tears, for it is one of our goals that <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es should meet <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s so<br/>
that everyone can enjoy the things they need without <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing tribute to<br/>
other <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="quot">> What is needed is more technology</span><br/>

Yes I <a href="know.htm">know</a> many people dream of the day when robots will do all of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>

<br/>
<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>es are not set <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificially within this system, they are set by "the market" just the same as in Capitalism.<br/>
<br/>
There are some very good reasons to do this:<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> Growth can only occur if more value is collected that the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of operation.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not collect <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>, then we will never have any extra <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s needed to include more people under our <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ion.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> will be collected by *someone*, so it may as well be *us*, for then we can treat it 'correctly'.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not collect <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> <small>(if we sell all <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>")</small>, then some customers will buy-up all of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t <small>(say apples)</small>, and then re-sell them closer to the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent market <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So when you buy such an apple, you will most likely <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>, just as you do when you buy from a grocery <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
You will receive a paper or electronic receipt at the point-of-sale that shows the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> you overpaid.<br/>
<br/>
This is also a legal <a href="title.htm">title</a> to your portion of that <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ed <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be more accurate to call it a bond, since the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers have not yet even purchased that <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
You could leave the receipt on the table, but since you already paid <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>, you have already bought into the farm.<br/>
<br/>
These receipts can be <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ed, and so are valuable even if you decide you don't like <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect you bought.<br/>
<br/>
More completely, each of these receipts can also act one-half of an '<a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ing' <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency.&nbsp;&nbsp;The other half of the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency is filled when <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>e to perform future labor within some window of time against those physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
When both halves of such a <a href="note.htm">note</a> are 'filled' - when you have sufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in apple trees, all supporting physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, and have commitments from <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>ed in taking care of those trees, harvesting the fruit, and preserving and <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>ing, etc. - then you are literally <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ed <small>(imperfectly)</small> against going without that specific <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ective.<br/>

<span class="quot">> Does this mean that the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s become <a href="part.htm">part</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of the farm?</span><br/>
<br/>
Within such a system, pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment - whether as initial <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing or as <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> paid - would be invested in *more* physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es that are not yet operational.<br/>
<br/>
For example: Let's say you <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> $5 for a hamburger from such an institution, but it only <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers $3.75 <small>(including all wages)</small> to deliver it to you <small>(and clean up after you, etc.)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e you paid and the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion was $1.25.<br/>
<br/>
That $1.25 is pooled with the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ments of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> by the many other customers.<br/>
<br/>
When there is enough <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s to act, the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers purchase *more* physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es with that revenue.<br/>
<br/>
But the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of each of those investments is retained by the original <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er.<br/>
<br/>
Your overpayment becomes your automatic investment in beef cattle, fields of alfalfa, tomatoes, potatoes, corn, chickens, etc. and all the <a href="land.htm">land</a> and water rights and tools and any other supporting <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er becomes <a href="part.htm">part</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>er in farms and factories, but would only become <a href="part.htm">part</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>er in some of the *<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent* physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es if there happen to be some up for sale, and that group of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers were accepting you as <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>er.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, and more often, your investment would be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to grow the size of the organization by purchasing even more physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
He who <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> slowly becomes <a href="own.htm">own</a>er,<br/>
He who <a href="own.htm">own</a>s enough no longer <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is invested by the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, but the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er would retain full <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of those 'shares'.<br/>
<br/>
These investments then 'vest' as their literal <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tiveness comes online.<br/>
<br/>
There seems to be a need for the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers to have some control over that investment, but that control must taper toward 0... or actually it should taper toward their % of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in any <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ed <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;A crude solution might be a time period where the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er is inhibited from immediately "cashing out".<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> Does this mean a <a href="new.htm">new</a> customer has to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> more than old customers, in</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> order to buy from them a share of the farm?</span><br/>
<br/>
The <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence is not between 'old' and '<a href="new.htm">new</a>', but between '<a href="own.htm">own</a>ing' and 'non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ing'.<br/>
<br/>
As a <a href="new.htm">new</a>, non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ing <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er, you have little choice but to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the $5.<br/>
<br/>
But as you <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> your percentage into the system <small>(as you <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small>, you accrue <a href="real.htm">real</a>, tangible, material, <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive, generative assets that are under your full dominion <small>(within limitations of <a href="real.htm">real</a>istic divisibility with other possible restrictions ...)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
When you <a href="own.htm">own</a> an apple tree, you must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of labor, tools, water, etc. but you do not <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>, for you <a href="own.htm">own</a> the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects already.<br/>
<br/>
When you <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> an apple tree orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> with some other people, then you must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the same things, and you <a href="own.htm">own</a> the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects already, but it is easier to do with others helping.<br/>
<br/>

Yes, corporations are homicidal megaliths because treating <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as <a href="own.htm">own</a>er reward is a positive-feed<a href="back.htm">back</a> loop incenting even more <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
But since <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> measures consumer dependence, and since scarcity increases consumer dependence, Corporations tend to withhold, restrict, disable, destroy.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>..<br/>
<br/>
Treating <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er investment is a negative-feed<a href="back.htm">back</a> loop that allows growth to occur, but tapers off <small>(<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s approach zero)</small> as consumers gains sufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in all the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
We can form <a href="new.htm">new</a> corporations under a special Terms of Operation that enforce this constraint, and any other rules we find may be needed to ensure <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

A better kind of inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a> is paid in <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t when he, as a future end-<a href="user.htm">user</a>, invests for the purpose of "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.<br/>

We can organize <a href="user.htm">user</a>s this way to "pre <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>" for the goods and services they need, but in this case they, the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s become full <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>

So, in order to perpetuate the <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom that comes from <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es your body requires, we must treat that overpayment <small>(<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> as though that <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="user.htm">user</a> were <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing an investment.<br/>

By doing so, we turn <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> against excessive accumulation for the few, and toward sufficient accumulation for the each.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
We can add <a href="new.htm">new</a> conditions to any <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty we <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>.<br/>
We can prevent <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects being separated from <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>

One way to lock-open the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es we need in our plight.<br/>

Let's share fields and factories.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="co-own.htm">Co-Own</a>ership is one way to hold physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.<br/>

<br/>
<a href="co-own.htm">Co-Own</a>ership is complicated but it's not impossible.<br/>
It is what the Capitalists are doing against us already!<br/>

But they do it wrong when they treat <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as reward.<br/>
Because this incents scarcity, destruction, even war.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>...<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es <a href="own.htm">own</a>s the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects too.<br/>
He is in control in a way that is good.<br/>
<br/>
But that goodness turns sour when he <a href="use.htm">use</a>s that control<br/>
to stop <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="user.htm">user</a>s from gaining <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom of their <a href="own.htm">own</a>.<br/>
<br/>
It is not clear he stops <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom when our usual stance,<br/>
is that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is reward for those who were there first.<br/>
<br/>
But <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> measures consumer dependence and scarcity.<br/>
It is the inverse of competition, it measures monopoly.<br/>
<br/>
Monopoly is not perfect, but neither is competition,<br/>
until each consumer's <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is sufficient.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="curr.htm">Curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers have an upper-hand because they organized.<br/>
This is good to a degree, but they take it too far.<br/>

<br/>
So organizing can be good, because we can then share <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s.<br/>
But it is also dangerous because we do not <a href="know.htm">know</a> how to scale.<br/>
<br/>
As Capitalism grows, control is concentrated.<br/>

A <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er becomes inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a> when he <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s more than <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.<br/>
But that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to reward those already in charge.<br/>
<br/>
So the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er gains nothing, even though he in need.<br/>
While the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers accumulates more through ignorant greed.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> in Capitalism doesn't become the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of those <a href="new.htm">new</a> Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es he <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ed, but is instead <a href="left.htm">left</a> in the cold as though his contribution meant nothing!<br/>
<br/>
In a better society, you will slowly gain <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership<br/>
in <a href="real.htm">real</a> Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es whenever you overpay.<br/>
<br/>
We will each <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> enough surface area, water rights, grain seed,<br/>
kitchen <small>(restaurant)</small>, grinders, mixers, kneaders, ovens,&nbsp;&nbsp;knives,<br/>
<br/>
Until you will eventually not buy bread,<br/>
for, as <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er, you <a href="own.htm">own</a> it already!<br/>

<br/>
No, they would only sell what they might want to get rid of.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> paid by consumers wouldn't buy-up the *<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent* assets <small>(unless for sale)</small>, but would be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e *<a href="new.htm">new</a>* investments - such as opening another restaurant or buying another roto-tiller or another <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> But since those</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> supplier companies likely won't do it, and there may be no other</span><br/>

<span class="quot">> <a href="real.htm">real</a> world in the context of open manufacturing. Maybe you can help me</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> understand?</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, the supplier is not required to sell any <a href="part.htm">part</a> of their <a href="own.htm">own</a> business.<br/>
<br/>
But they may be ignored as we "go around" them seeking <a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For example:<br/>
<br/>
Let's say we begin the "<a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom Cafe".<br/>
<br/>
Let's also say we were able to organize enough pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing customers<br/>
that the entire corporation is <a href="user.htm">user</a>-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ed.<br/>
<br/>
Now, when a potential customer arrives that has insufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership,<br/>
we will sell him a meal too, but will charge a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <small>(<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
We *do* collect <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> from him, but <a href="use.htm">use</a> that overpayment to invest *for*<br/>
him.&nbsp;&nbsp;So if he paid $5 for a hamburger that only <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> us $3.75 to deliver,<br/>
Then we would be investing that $1.25 by purchasing wheat fields <small>(for<br/>
the bun)</small>, tomato fields <small>(tomatoes and ketchup)</small>, spice fields, beef cattle,<br/>
etc. and all the tools and wages needed to turn those <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es into future<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts - so he incrementally gains <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership to such a degree that he<br/>
finally <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>s enough of the entire tree of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t<br/>
that he has maximized control and minimumized <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e <small>(<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e will reach <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>)</small>.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Here is another <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el causing a much <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> outcome:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Get 1,000 potential customers to commit $100 each<br/>
<small>(or 100 people at $1,000 - or allow any size investment)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Then <a href="use.htm">use</a> that $100,000, to open a <a href="new.htm">NEW</a> restaurant <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by THOSE <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
It would not be "one member == one vote", but each <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>er would have exactly as much vote as he has <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, instead of hoping a random business <a href="own.htm">own</a>er will do as we please,<br/>
maybe *WE* <small>(a group of pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing consumers)</small> could <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of the things we need?<br/>
<br/>
Then we could hire a manager and some cooks and custodian, etc.<br/>
We would <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of operation - just as a normal restaurant.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There would be three primary <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erences:<br/>
<br/>
1. We, <small>(the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing customers)</small>, would have full control of everything, including the <a href="menu.htm">menu</a> and operating hours.<br/>
<br/>
2. We, <small>(the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing customers)</small>, would never <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the extra expense of<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>, so would receive everything "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>".<br/>
<br/>
3. To address the issue of "non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ing" customers we simply charge them "what the market will bear" <small>(so we would collect <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> from them)</small>, but then treat their overpayment as though they were also investing - so that as the kitchen/restaurant grows - as we open a <a href="new.htm">new</a> location, etc., the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of those <a href="new.htm">new</a> investments will be retained by the original <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er - so that eventually EVERYONE would be invested in their <a href="own.htm">own</a> local <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ed kitchen so that every <a href="user.htm">user</a> has the <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom that comes from control which can be gained through regular <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
----<br/>
In light of the goals of OpenKollab:<br/>
<br/>
A more <a href="real.htm">real</a>istic variation would have some percentage of the initial inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s be regular <small>(or "social leaning" VC)</small>, while the rest would be future customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;That would cause non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ing consumers to receive less than full <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of the investments made from the <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> they <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>, but would still move us the right direction - just more slowly.<br/>

<br/>
I hope this is true, but if so, then why would anyone invest?<br/>
<br/>
My answer to that is: Let's get the end-<a href="user.htm">user</a> <small>(or consumer)</small> to invest<br/>
for "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t <small>(think of it as a pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment plan)</small> since he<br/>
would then receive those outputs without <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> while also<br/>
gaining the control he has for so long been without.<br/>
<br/>
On a related <a href="note.htm">note</a>: What would you say is the 'origin' of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>?&nbsp;&nbsp;Why<br/>
does the consumer consent to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>, and what is<br/>
the 'correct' treatment of that value in the better system?<br/>
<br/>
My answer is to treat that overpayment as though the consumer were<br/>
<a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing a tiny investment - so he slowly gains <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Means<br/>
of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion for the purpose of solidifying his ability to receive<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" while also helping him gain the control he needs to<br/>
finally be able to claim "<a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom" in the physical <a href="real.htm">real</a>m.<br/>
<br/>
Treating <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as a <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er's investment allows growth to occur, but<br/>
causes the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in that growth is 'distributed' to those who are<br/>
willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for it.<br/>
