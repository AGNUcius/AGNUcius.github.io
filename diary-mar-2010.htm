Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
The original purpose of Government is <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
That is OK when the purpose of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion is <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
Under that condition <small>(usually coincident to small groups)</small>, the people composing the operational body <small>(the Corpse or Corporation)</small> are the direct beneficiaries of that <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion and are also in direct Control as literal Governors of that <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion and Governance are on the same side because they are the very same set of people, and are <a href="own.htm">Own</a>in and <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ing for thier <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="use.htm">Use</a> Value.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But when the purpose of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion is <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, well the <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>y changes considerably because <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> requires Scarcity and Dependence which drives those <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers to <a href="work.htm">work</a> against the '<a href="real.htm">real</a>' goals of society.<br/>
<br/>
Under that condition, the people composing the operational body <small>(the Corpse or Corporation)</small> are a set of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers that are NOT the <a href="user.htm">User</a>s of the Outputs of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion even though they are in direct Control as literal Governors of that <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
I have an <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a implemented through a contract ~ or actually a kind of self-inflicted and legally binding "Inter-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>er <a href="trad.htm">Trad</a>e <a href="agree.htm">Agree</a>ment <small>(<a href="iota.htm">IOTA</a>)</small>" that is willingly applied to private <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty by the <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers of that <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty would be held privately by each group, but for the explicit purpose of hosting a specialized sort of commons similar in initial structure to <a class="ext" href="http://P2PFoundation.net/Common_Property_Regime">http://P2PFoundation.net/Common_Property_Regime</a> =<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">"'In common <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty regimes there is no <a href="free.htm">free</a> access to the re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e and common-pool re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es are not public goods. While there is relatively <a href="free.htm">free</a> but <a href="moni.htm">moni</a>tored access to the re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e system for community members, there are mechanisms in place which allow the community to exclude outsiders from using its re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e. Thus, in a common <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty regime, a common-pool re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e has the appearance of a private good from the outside and that of a common good from the point of view of an insider. The re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e units withdrawn from the system are typically <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed individually by the ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riators.'"</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is similar in purpose to <a class="ext" href="http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_ownership">http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_ownership</a> with some very specific rules for enforcing "<a href="user.htm">user</a> <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom" in the physical world by treating <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as a <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er's Investment.<br/>
<br/>
It is intended to help interested groups to <a href="co-own.htm">Co-Own</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tive <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es for their <a href="own.htm">own</a> benefit.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a is to create a large numbers of smaller semi-private 'commons' that are under the full dominion of those <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
Each 'common' would be private <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, usually with more than one <a href="own.htm">own</a>er over things such as <a href="land.htm">land</a>, <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>dings, tools, plants, animals, etc.<br/>
<br/>
In this case there is no separation between the governing and the governed --- they are the same set.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This approach also solves the issue of Tyranny of the majority through what I call "pre-emptive secession" implemented in two ways:<br/>
<br/>
1. By inverting the typical structure of taxation to a <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el where any group-<a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ed operation <small>(think "public utility")</small> is only accomplished if the sub-group attempting that goal can get enough others to commit <a href="work.htm">work</a> and/or re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es toward it. Anyone disinterested in that initiative is not effected and need do nothing <small>(there is no "opt-out" procedure)</small>. There are some complexities such as border issues and others that need to be detailed...<br/>
<br/>
2. By offering <small>(through the above-mentioned contract)</small> a "maximum divisibility" for each physical re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e - so that sub-groups can split <small>(or 'fork')</small> from the rest of the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers in that group.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<span class="quot">> How about a new city in the USA designed for walkability?</span><br/>
<br/>
Walkability is hindered by a <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty tax structure that punishes improvements instead of weighing against excessive holdings.<br/>
<br/>
This creates a 'speculation' market for physical location where inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s <small>(or even innocent farmers that find themselves encroached-upon by the growth of a city)</small> can hold large a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a>s of <a href="land.htm">land</a> *just as long* as they do not develop it.<br/>
<br/>
This is why we see so many underdeveloped patches within cities.&nbsp;&nbsp;These un<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive lots add distance to our travel and so cause excessive transport of both goods and humans.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> the deeper issue is how we <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d our <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>ology into our physical infrastructure.</span><br/>
<br/>
The P2P movement can create a physical infrastructure if we can formulate a <a href="real.htm">real</a>istic "<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <a href="recover.htm">recover</a>y" mechanism so we can begin hosting the intiatives we seek.<br/>
<br/>
This requirement applies to 'online' <a href="work.htm">work</a> such as a social <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>ing site that needs physical <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ters and <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>dings and electricity and <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers to <a href="install.htm">install</a> and manage them etc.<br/>
<br/>
And applies equally to 'offline' <a href="work.htm">work</a> such as <a href="install.htm">install</a>ing <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful plants and mushrooms on 'public' grounds within our <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> city.<br/>
<br/>
In either case we must discover a way to cover the expenses of operation.<br/>
<br/>
Governments have <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itionally taken the approach of "gather a bunch of <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y into a slush-<a href="fund.htm">fund</a>, then dole-out <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing to projects as some 'representative' council sees fit".<br/>
<br/>
A much more direct, and in my opinion, "P2P" approach that avoids some of the "Tyranny of the Majority", allowing citizens to retain much more control would be:<br/>
<br/>
1. Allow any citizen to 'advertise' any project <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>osal.<br/>
2. Other citizens that become interested may choose to <a href="fund.htm">fund</a> those projects.<br/>
2a. <a href="fund.htm">Fund</a>ing can be in the form of <a href="mone.htm">Mone</a>y <small>(Will add X$)</small> or Labor <small>(Will <a href="work.htm">work</a> to accomlish Y a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of some goal)</small> or Physical assets <small>(Will supply a roto-tiller during some window of time)</small>.<br/>
3. When any project receives enough <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing, then it can begin implementation.<br/>
4. Citizens who helped <a href="fund.htm">fund</a> the project are stakeholders in the same % that they invested.<br/>
5. Citizen do not <a href="fund.htm">fund</a> projects they do not care about, so have much more control.<br/>

I have such a <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> view, it must be only <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the solution...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We are animals.&nbsp;&nbsp;We *must* have shelter, food, water, clothing, medical assistance, and all the services that <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e those things possible.<br/>
<br/>
Many people must <a href="work.htm">work</a> almost every waking moment to meet even their most basic needs.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="mone.htm">Mone</a>y is important to begin, but we also need hands and hearts ready to get things done, and the ability to do so that without a financial umbilical-cord to the 'outside' world.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So here's my <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a:<br/>
<br/>
How about attracting people that are financially stressed but are otherwise fit for <a href="work.htm">work</a> in fields specifically within the <a href="real.htm">real</a>m of supplying the needs of *that very community* such as: <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>ding construction, agriculture, food preparation, medicine, <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine repair,<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
The VC inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s would be 'hiring' these <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers, but instead of <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing with <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y, they are paid by receiving their basic necessities of food, shelter, sanitation, transportation, etc. for <a href="free.htm">free</a>.<br/>
<br/>
As they were allowed to continue to <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d, they would also <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d schools and hospitals that they could <a href="use.htm">use</a> for no more than <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Using permaculture, after a few seasons they would be <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing far more nut, fruits, spices, etc. than they could ever <a href="use.htm">use</a> for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Some of that surplus would be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the VC inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
There is more to write, but it's not coming to me right now...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Patrick<br/>

Pietro Speroni di Fenizio wrote:<br/>
<span class="quot">> Why do you say that you have no control over MG?</span><br/>
<br/>
Control rests finally in <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ing physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es gives you control of the results.<br/>
<br/>
In this specific instance, I have no <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the<br/>
<a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ters hosting that software, and I don't help <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> any of the <a href="real.htm">real</a><br/>
<a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s to maintain them, so can only hope whoever is <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing will let me<br/>
keep playing.<br/>
<br/>
Each of us <a href="own.htm">own</a>s the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of almost NONE of our needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is too<br/>
<a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult all alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>iculty of fully utilizing the<br/>
tools, but also a lack of advanced <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s needed to perform some sorts<br/>
of <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
We need to learn how to Get Together for our <a href="own.htm">own</a>, <a href="collab.htm">collab</a>orative<br/>
benefit instead of shaping our notion of exchange as one of predation<br/>
and advantage.<br/>
<br/>
I like Ed's mention of a "<a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing mechanism".<br/>
<br/>
If we could help interested <a href="part.htm">part</a>ies communicate, those groups could<br/>
more easily buy Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es and hold them as "<a href="collab.htm">Collab</a>orative<br/>
<a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty" for the purpose of <a href="use.htm">Use</a> Value alone.<br/>
<br/>
We could then buy and <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d farms, daries, factories, theatres,<br/>
go-cart tracks, etc.<br/>
<br/>
But since we <small>(each group)</small> would <a href="own.htm">own</a> them outright, then the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e<br/>
would be the simple <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of operation and <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> would be zero.<br/>
<br/>
This is fine for the <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ic case, but once a non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er wants access,<br/>
then we must have a rule about <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;For <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is a measure of<br/>
<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er dependence, and so should be treated as his pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment toward<br/>
the purchase of more physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
When <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> becomes <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, then <a href="collab.htm">collab</a>oration is perpetuated.<br/>
<br/>
This way we can grow in a strange way that avoids the overaccumulation<br/>
that Capitalism suffers.<br/>

<br/>
I heard <small>(was it from you, Amanda?)</small> that some of these good people are considered 'gatekeepers'.<br/>
<br/>
I think they are probably most often ignorant and so innocent of the harm they cause as they distract us from <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>amental r<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>sideration of our directions.<br/>
<br/>
This is done by leading us to spend our time and energy thinking about very specific issues *within* the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent contexts of war, <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic turmoil, poverty, etc.<br/>
<br/>
This creates a very limited '<a href="arena.htm">arena</a>' of thought and discourse - where there is much to chatter about how things "shouldn't be that way", but no time to sort of "step out" of those contexts to ask why or how we got here in the first place...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> We can learn from many <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es</span><br/>
<br/>
Yes, but we can also be 'programmed' from many <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, including text.<br/>
<br/>
You might be tempted to think "well, it's not so likely if the book is very old" but I would say that is no guarantee at all.<br/>
<br/>
But even Joel <a href="know.htm">know</a>s that one of the oldest and certainly the most <a href="know.htm">know</a> text: the Sun Book <small>(Holy Bible)</small> has shaped our society in such deeply profound ways that the soup of deceptions and distractions we <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>e within can <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ly be considered separate from <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ective <a href="real.htm">real</a>ity.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm...&nbsp;&nbsp;I just noticed this is another obvious 'corralling' of our thoughts - narrowing the focus of any adhe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> by nearly forcing them <small>(through threat of eternal death)</small> to <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d every discussion<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
My reason for low interest in MG is approximately the same as for my apathy toward all other governments I already <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for: I do not have any *<a href="real.htm">real</a>* control.<br/>
<br/>
My explanation for this lack of control has to do with how <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional taxation and donations do not let the individual 'target' those investments toward what he thinks are important, but are instead put into a sort of "slush <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>" that a well-intentioned committee or other 'representative' then <a href="use.htm">use</a>s as THEY see fit.<br/>
<br/>
For example, let's say a City-Council decides they should <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d a new "Recreation Center" for citizens to <a href="use.htm">use</a> in various ways.<br/>
<br/>
With <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional taxation, I am *required* to help <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for that construction unless I can get a majority of others to complain that it is not needed because I already paid taxes into an untargeted "slush <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>".<br/>
<br/>
I cannot opt-out unless I group with others to opt-out.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I 'win' by stopping construction, it causes others to 'lose' because they DID want to <a href="fund.htm">fund</a> the project.<br/>
<br/>
An 'opt-in' approach would allow individuals to <a href="fund.htm">fund</a> only the initiatives they appreciate, while leaving others to do as they please as well.<br/>
<br/>
Under such an arrangement, if 99% of the citizens want some certain project, and 1% do not, then the 99% choose to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for it, and the 1% can simply ignore it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody loses and nobody is forced to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for something they do not want.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This all seems a bit disconnected from MG since I've never given any donation here <small>(though I guess <a href="work.htm">work</a> such as this e<a href="mail.htm">mail</a>, if considered valuable, might be a form of donation?)</small>...<br/>
<br/>
But I *would* be willing to send <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y and add value in other ways IF I have the control to *target* that value, and also to gain <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <small>(Material Assets)</small> <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to host the MG activity.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, toward answering the other <a href="part.htm">part</a>s of this e<a href="mail.htm">mail</a> about pooling re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es I present a challenge:<br/>
<br/>
Could we host an instance of <a class="ext" href="http://EtherPad.GoogleCode.com">http://EtherPad.GoogleCode.com</a> server, and if so, how and who would <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> those extra <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s?<br/>
