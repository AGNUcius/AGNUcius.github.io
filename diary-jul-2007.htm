<span class="h4">====Consumer control and "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts</span><br/>
<br/>
I am not talking about 'confiscation' because what I am suggesting is a voluntary contract that some business <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers would choose to keep in place on their <a href="own.htm">own</a> accord for the community <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>ding benefits it would bestow to them.<br/>
<br/>
Think of these corporations as self-declared public utilities.<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn't you be happy to be <a href="part.htm">part</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>er in a farm that you had direct vote control over whether the crops were Genetically <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>ified or not? And the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e you would <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts of that farm would be <small>(approach)</small> exactly <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
So, after <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing managerial wages <small>(assuming you hired someone to manage the farm)</small>, <a href="work.htm">work</a>er wages, <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ments on equipment, water and fuel and maintenance - in other words, all the things a farmer <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s - you would have the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t in the <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>e<small>(house)</small>, and YOU <small>(the consumer)</small> would already <a href="own.htm">OWN</a> that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
And wouldn't it be nice to <a href="own.htm">own</a> a tiny % of a processing factory, so that some of the organic, heirloom grains that you voted <small>(between the other <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of that small farm)</small> to grow on YOUR farm could be turned into breakfast ce<a href="real.htm">real</a>s, breads and crackers without suffering the externality of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>? Do we <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly need to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> $4 a box for ce<a href="real.htm">real</a> when the US federal government is using our tax dollars to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> those same farmers to NOT grow?<br/>
<br/>
When people choose to not apply the contract then they could do as you say, but those businesses will soon be 'outperformed' by the groups that choose to apply the contract, since those consumer/<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers will be getting a far better deal.<br/>
<br/>
The typical Capitalist <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>e of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion will become unimportant after this contract is finally written and is applied to <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects and the physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of those <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects.<br/>
<br/>
I don't plan to implement strict Georgism, nor as a tax, but will try to answer this as though I would:<br/>
<br/>
It is the incorrect structure of typical taxes that allows speculators to keep their excessive holdings.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, why does <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty tax punish improvements while ignoring the empty and underdeveloped lots near the middle of large cities?<br/>
<br/>
If <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty tax were structured as HG would have it, then cities would not sprawl as they do, but would be extraordinarily dense because every square foot would be exponentially more expensive to hold as you neared the center.<br/>
<br/>
There may not appear to be "excessive holdings", but look closely at the strips of idle <a href="land.htm">land</a> behind <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>es and scattered throughout a city. All of that would be under intense <a href="use.htm">use</a> if weren't so easy <small>(if tax were weighted against)</small> holding it.<br/>

What if some consumers could organize enough to collectively purchase some farm<a href="land.htm">land</a>, water rights and tools?<br/>
<br/>

<span class="h4">====Subject: <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ion</span><br/>
<br/>
Hello all.<br/>
<br/>
I have a question that is indirectly about HG's Single Tax <small>(Community <a href="rent.htm">Rent</a>)</small> and directly about "<a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omic Justice".<br/>
<br/>
I have been reading "<a href="mone.htm">Mone</a>y; A Mirror <a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>e Of The <a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omy" at <a class="ext" href="http://IED.info/books/money">http://IED.info/books/money</a> <small>(which can be <a href="free.htm">free</a>ly downloaded)</small> which extends HG's discovery as: <span class="quot">"'Applying Henry George's philosophy across the <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic spectrum transposes monopoly <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> values into equally-shared <a href="use.htm">use</a>-values.'"</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The question is about the concept of "<a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>e of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion" as originally defined by Marx <small>(see <a class="ext" href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_of_production">http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_of_production</a> )</small>.<br/>
<br/>
What I am noticing is that there is a special, almost magical case when a <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t consumer <small>(of apples for instance)</small> happen to be the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of the means of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <small>(the <a href="land.htm">land</a>, trees, tools and water rights)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
When that is the case <small>(<a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect Consumer == <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er)</small>, then the typical schizophrenia of <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omics <small>(think "Falacy of the Broken Window", "Candlemakers Petition", "Crisis of Value", "Creative Destruction", etc.)</small> no longer apply.<br/>
<br/>
This is similar to thinking of a stranded is<a href="land.htm">land</a>er, but is more general.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers of the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion happen to also be the only Consumers of the Output, the following seems to be true:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span> <a href="employ.htm">Employ</a>ment is no longer a goal, but a hurdle to overcome.<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span> Keeping <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <small>(<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> is meaningless, unless you were to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> yourself.<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span> Wages may be paid to any <a href="work.htm">work</a>er you hire, but that is a <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>, not <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span> Scarcity is not needed to <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e success, as <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is the only goal.<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span> 'Dumping' by foreign entities is not a problem as abundance is only a problem for <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is a volatile <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e when there are more than one consumer, but before we discuss that I would like to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e sure these claims are not faulty.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your consideration and thought in answering.<br/>

Government is driven by corporations.<br/>
Corporations are driven by <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is driven by <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity.<br/>
<a href="art.htm">Art</a>ificial scarcity is the <a href="delet.htm">delet</a>ion and destruction of nature and <a href="know.htm">know</a>ledge.<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is an unnecessary burden that is overcome whenever <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect Consumers are <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers.<br/>
<a href="employ.htm">Employ</a>ment is not a need in itself, but a hurdle to overcome when <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect Consumers are <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers.<br/>
We need to write a <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment - a kind of social contract that can be applied to physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es and their <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects that will cause <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> to be treated as an investment for that Consumer at each transaction<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is Consumer_<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s |where| <a href="work.htm">Work</a>er_Wage is one of those <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s.<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is an inverse measure of Consumer development, and is balanced by treating it as a cry for growth by investing it in more physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es that will <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e future <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of that same kind of <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect.<br/>

Nate, you probably <a href="know.htm">know</a> I have <small>(had)</small> similar <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>as, though I don't remember what I've told you, and my viewpoint has been changing over time.<br/>
<br/>
I'm deeply concerned about how the <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy is structured to <a href="work.htm">work</a> against consumers through <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity.&nbsp;&nbsp;We tend to accept this as an inevitable <a href="part.htm">part</a> of society - as though it would be impossible to <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e amongst ourselves without suffering <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
This almost universal pr<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>ception is now sending more and more people out of the cities as they sense the imminent collapse of our <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy.<br/>
<br/>
Assuming some of these communities 'succeed', could anything <small>(such as a social contract nudge, nudge)</small> keep them from eventually failing in the same way?<br/>
<br/>
Is human society inescapably unstable, or is there a problem with re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e allocation that could be addressed so we might <a href="work.htm">work</a> toward permaculture?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<hr/><span class="date">Jul-02-2007:</span> Posted to <a class="ext" href="http://Blog.P2PFoundation.net/on-the-contradiction-between-openness-and-profits/2007/07/02">Blog.P2PFoundation.net/on-the-contradiction-between-openness-and-profits/2007/07/02</a><br/>
Business 'bills' are a <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>, so are BY DEFINITION not paid through <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, since <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> = Consumer_<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e - <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s. This is even more obvious for a Non-<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> corporation.<br/>
<br/>
But if you are thinking of the 'bills' of the individual <small>(what can a <a href="work.htm">Work</a>er take home to feed his family)</small>, then you are talking about Wage, which is ALSO <a href="calc.htm">calc</a>ulated as a <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
So <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> never need be collected by <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers, but should only be treated as Consumer Growth by investing it as shares of <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership in that same corporation for that very same Consumer. In this way the business becomes a public utility <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ed by every Consumer in direct <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ortion to the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> each is willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The separate question of how a <a href="work.htm">Work</a>er can collect a Wage from Consumers willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a> is mostly a matter of contracting with those Consumers _before_ performing the <a href="work.htm">work</a>. The solution to how programmers can "<a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y" from <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software is to discover what the Consumers want that is not already accomplished, and then to have those consumers somehow 'commit' to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment for delivery of those change before the <a href="work.htm">Work</a>er performs the act <small>(or at least before he releases his private <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ifications)</small>.<br/>
