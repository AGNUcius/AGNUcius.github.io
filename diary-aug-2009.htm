<br/>
Yes, that is correct.&nbsp;&nbsp;But confusingly, a perfect market would be *fatal* for Capitalists - for what other reason are they in business?<br/>
<br/>
<a href="part.htm">Part</a> of <a class="ext" href="http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_competition">http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_competition</a> reads:<br/>
<span class="quot">"'According to the standard <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omical definition of efficiency <small>(Pareto efficiency)</small>, perfect competition would lead to a completely efficient outcome. The analysis of perfectly competitive markets provides the foundation of the theory of supply and demand. Perfect competition is a market equilibrium in which all re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es are allocated and <a href="use.htm">use</a>d efficiently, and collective social welfare is maximized.'"</span><br/>
<br/>
Since perfecting competition causes <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e to approach <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>, a strange situation occurs where normal "For <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>" businesses - who measure their success by the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> they can keep <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> - would close their doors proclaiming failure during perfect competition.<br/>
<br/>
Now, a business must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> it's inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s SOMETHING, otherwise, why would they invest?&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s are expecting <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>, then they require the business they invested in to be able to operate in an imperfect market.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is a measure of this imperfection.<br/>
<br/>
But there is another thing that we could <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s if we choose those inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s from a very special set:<br/>
<br/>
If the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s of a business are the very CONSUMERS of the intended ouputs of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, then they would be satisfied with receiving "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t alone, and would never need the business to keep <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
A consuming-inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>'s return on investment would be receiving the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t at a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e that is exactly the same as <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
When the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion are the very consumers of the output, the organization can withstand perfect competition because those that pre-paid will be expecting <a href="produc.htm">PRODUC</a>T, not <a href="profit.htm">PROFIT</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot2">>> Who will be willing to invest in <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion if <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is zero?</span><br/>

<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> You're forgetting another group. <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ers would also invest, because</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> their <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>elihood depends on it. So you'd have a mixed bag of consumer</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> and <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>er <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed businesses.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> Interestingly, businesses <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed and operated by consumers have been a</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> long-standing feature of the cooperative movement.</span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional definition of a "Consumers' Cooperative" shows the individual consumers are not in control, but have instead forfeited their rights to a representative committee that causes the organization to be run largely the same as a for-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> corporation.<br/>
<br/>
<a class="ext" href="http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumers%27_cooperative">http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumers%27_cooperative</a> tells us: <span class="quot">"'Every year members receive a share of the <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s that they helped to create, based on the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> made in <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s that year and the how much they had spent with any of its businesses.'"</span><br/>
<br/>
And <a class="ext" href="http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Co-operative_Group">http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Co-operative_Group</a> tells us there was <span class="quot">"'Revenue over 13 billion'"</span> in 2009.<br/>
<br/>
But <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> only occurs when a consumer must buy the good from an <a href="own.htm">own</a>er at a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.<br/>
<a href="trad.htm">Trad</a>ing goods only occurs when the consumer has insufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion - for when his <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is sufficient, he does not 'buy' apples, but instead <a href="own.htm">own</a>s them already as a result of his <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es and pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <small>(with wages being one of those <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s)</small>.<br/>

"<a href="back.htm">Back</a>lash" is our impotent and immature reaction to our lack of preparedness.<br/>
<br/>
For how long will the 'We' wait for someone else to organize for us in the 'correct' way?<br/>
<br/>
The 'We' must stop thinking that it can "lash <a href="back.htm">back</a>" at Capitalists that have the forethought and tenacity to organize for us.<br/>
<br/>
The 'We' must <a href="start.htm">start</a> thinking about how to "get together" and organize for our <a href="own.htm">own</a> collective and inclusive <small>(all <a href="user.htm">user</a>s must have <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom)</small> benefit instead of just complaining that somebody else is doing it wrong - especially when those that the We feel are do it wrong had the intention of taking advantage of Us from the very beginning!<br/>
<br/>
The 'We' is paralyzed because of the fear of <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
The 'We' believes physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es can never be held for the sole purpose of "<a href="use.htm">Use</a> Value".<br/>
<br/>
The 'We' has been hypnotized into the false dichotomy between "Capitalism" and "Communism" as though there weren't infinite other ways to organize.<br/>
<br/>
The 'We' will never move forward until we face the combination of power and <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom that is "<a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership" to discover exactly what is wrong and then begin to buy and <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> those Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es in a 'righteous' manner for the material sphere similar to how the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> <a href="use.htm">use</a>s Copyright against <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>rietary holdings in the <a href="real.htm">real</a>m of 'design'.<br/>
<br/>
The 'We' does not understand the meaning and purpose of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> <small>(<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>)</small>, and so fear it also.<br/>
<br/>
When the 'We' can finally see <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is a measure of <a href="user.htm">user</a> dependence upon the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, then the 'We' can begin using it to balance growth and autodistribute control to all those willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Treating <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as an investment from the <a href="user.htm">user</a> who paid it will cause the Capitalist to become unimportant as competition <small>(in <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of the Material Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion)</small> will approach perfection - thus causing any <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> collected against each of those <a href="user.htm">user</a>s to approach zero and therefore 'destroying' the market since <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e will safely meet <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.<br/>

<hr/><span class="date">Aug-10-2009:</span> <a class="ext" href="http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-operative_economics">Wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-operative_economics</a> splits Cooperatives into "Co-operative Federalism", "Co-operative Individualism" and "Retailers' cooperatives".<br/>
<br/>
"Co-operative Federalism" is supposedly consumer-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ed, but this is clearly is not perpetually true since <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s would need to be treated as consumer investment yet: <span class="quot">"'<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s <small>(or surpluses)</small> from these co-operative wholesale societies should be paid as dividends to the member co-operators, rather than to their <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers'"</span>.<br/>

"Co-operative Individualism" is <a href="work.htm">work</a>er-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ed, and so is of little interest to us here.<br/>

<br/>
<hr/><span class="date">Aug-07-2009:</span> The structure and goals of a "Consumers' Cooperative" <small>(CC)</small> as defined at <a class="ext" href="http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumers%27_cooperative">Wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumers%27_cooperative</a> are massively <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> from those of a Consumer Capital Cooperative <small>(CCC)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The internal <a href="work.htm">work</a>ings and final outcome barely resemble each other.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Structural <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erences</span><br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> A CC is a committee-<a href="admin.htm">admin</a>istered entity which inflicts "Tyranny of the Majority" dragnet compliance through slush-<a href="fund.htm">fund</a> fees.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> A CCC is not an <a href="admin.htm">admin</a>istrative entity and has no defined committee, but is merely an observation that many independent <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers using the CCCC may choose to <a href="work.htm">work</a> together for the benefits it brings.&nbsp;&nbsp;We define a CCC only for the purpose of easily talking about such groups of <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers, but that cooperation is neither mandatory nor centrally managed.&nbsp;&nbsp;The CCCC may even need a clause to help keep otherwise independent groups from being coerced into <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipating in governance or being drawn into clustering policies which some personalities will likely want to inflict during later stages of development.<br/>
<br/>
It is now clear to me how misleading it is to utilize the term 'cooperative' since that word is <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itionally envisioned as an overarching entity of control instead of the loosely connected independent groups of <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers which the CCCC would foster.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership of the outputs</span><br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> A CC entity <a href="own.htm">own</a>s the outputs of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and sells those goods <a href="back.htm">back</a> to each individual consumer/<a href="own.htm">own</a>er - causing <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> even if consumer/<a href="own.htm">own</a>er had sufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership to have been the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of those goods already.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> When using the CCCC, the individual <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of each individual Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e is the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of the ouputs of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, so goods are not sold unless the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er decides he has an 'excess' and chooses to do so - but in that case <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> must be treated as an investment from the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> A CC may have arbitrary conditions of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership applied homogenously to all Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es across the entire cooperative such as <span class="quot">"'Membership is open to everyone as long as they share the Group's values and principles.'"</span> <small>[ <a class="ext" href="http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Co-operative_Group">Wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Co-operative_Group</a> ]</small><br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> The CCCC has only one condition of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership: If the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of an <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect under the CCCC choose to sell, give, <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>, <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e, share, <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agate or convey that <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect - any <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> must be retained by the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er as a receipt of investment in more <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.&nbsp;&nbsp;This investment is <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently <a href="know.htm">know</a>n as a <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t Future.<br/>
