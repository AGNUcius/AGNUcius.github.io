Listening to Fredric Bastiat's "Sophisms of the <a href="protect.htm">Protect</a>ionists" at <a href="http.htm">http</a>:/<a class="ext" href="http://LibriVox.org/sophisms-of-the-protectionists-by-frederic-bastiat">LibriVox.org/sophisms-of-the-protectionists-by-frederic-bastiat</a><br/>
<br/>
His approach is <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful and humorous in exposing how <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers <small>(<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, not <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers)</small> seek scarcity when they seek <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>, though I dis<a href="agree.htm">agree</a> with his <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>osal of absolute <a href="free.htm">Free</a> <a href="trad.htm">Trad</a>e as the solution since this does not address the <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>amental drive for scarcity.<br/>
<br/>
We can side-step this problem by choosing only inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s who are willing to accept <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t itself as the return on investment.<br/>
<br/>
When a group of consumers micro-invest to <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of a <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, they receive the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t as reward for that risk without even needing to buy or sell the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t since it is alreay in the hands of those who need it.<br/>
<br/>
In such a scenario, there is no chance for <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> to even occur and so the *unnatural* drnive for scarcity <small>(ask yourself if seeking scarcity is natural or not)</small> is eliminated before it can even begin.<br/>
<br/>
<hr/><span class="date">Feb-25-2013:</span> Thinking of the data structures required for a board-<a href="game.htm">game</a> representation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<hr/><span class="date">Feb-25-2013:</span> Noticed <a class="ext" href="http://CropTrust.org">CropTrust.org</a> and worry about the false sense of security when all <a href="know.htm">know</a> seed varieties are concentrated into a single location.<br/>
<br/>
<hr/><span class="date">Feb-25-2013:</span> Another attempt a few days ago on the 'contact' list:<br/>
<br/>
1. Consumers become <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers when the micro-invest just enough<br/>
to gain the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty needed to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e what they predict they will<br/>
need.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bit like crowd <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing, but the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s become <a href="real.htm">real</a><br/>
<a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers in the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <a href="arena.htm">Arena</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Strangely, this means the<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t does not need to be sold because it is already in the hands of<br/>
those who need it and so the <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e they <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> as consumers is simply the<br/>
<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s they paid as <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers and so <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is 0 <small>(actually it is undefined<br/>
because the transaction is missing)</small>. This means external governments<br/>
cannot collect sales tax on the missing transaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;See<br/>
<a class="ext" href="athttp://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Imputed_rent">athttp://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Imputed_rent</a> for a <a href="part.htm">part</a>ial explanation.<br/>
<br/>
2. <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers also receive <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership in the <a href="land.htm">land</a> and tools <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e that which they need <small>(not necessarily that which they have<br/>
<a href="skill.htm">skill</a> and desire to 'operate')</small> when they commit <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>es to <a href="work.htm">work</a> in<br/>
the future. This is a sort of "<a href="work.htm">work</a> bond" that eliminates <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional<br/>
wages and puts <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers on equal footing with other inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s. This<br/>
means external governments cannot collect income tax because there is<br/>
no transaction to tax. See <a class="ext" href="http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Imputed_income">http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Imputed_income</a><br/>
<br/>
3. Each <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>er may do whatever they like with their <a href="own.htm">own</a> surplus, but<br/>
if they just leave it in one of our <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>ehouses, it will be sold to<br/>
those with insufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership for a <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>, but will then treat<br/>
that overpayment as an investment from that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er so that each<br/>
consumer also incrementally gains the <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership needed to supply<br/>
them with the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts they need in the future. This also means the<br/>
growth of that business is autodistributed to those willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for<br/>
that growth.<br/>
<br/>
4. Any subgroup must be able to secede from the group for any reason<br/>
while retaining their portion of the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, or when the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty is<br/>
not <a href="real.htm">real</a>istically divisible, able to sell their portion.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an<br/>
attempt to solve the Tyranny of the Majority problem.<br/>
<br/>

<hr/><span class="date">Feb-04-2013:</span> Basic Outcome<br/>
<br/>
We all need water, food, housing, medicine, clothing, health care, child care, education, transportation, electricity, gas, sewer, recycling, etc.<br/>
<br/>
A <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> is the <a href="land.htm">land</a> <small>(without mortgage)</small>, water-rights, plants, animals, tools and energy <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to create a Basic Outcome.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
0.)</small> Inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s become <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> A <a href="promis.htm">Promis</a>e-to-<a href="work.htm">work</a> is an Investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means middle-to-lower income Consumers will prepay <small>(think a variant of crowd <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>ing mixed with scheduled time-<a href="bank.htm">bank</a>ing)</small> by committing to <a href="work.htm">work</a> in the future in return for <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t is the Inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>'s return.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is never sold <small>(except surplus as defined in #3)</small> because each <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>er has spread their investments across all the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion for which they predict they will need the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects, and in just enough to receive the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> the need.&nbsp;&nbsp;This eliminates <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> because the final transaction does not occur.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is <a href="know.htm">know</a>n as <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic <a href="imput.htm">imput</a>ation.<br/>
<br/>
3.)</small> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er's Investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means we will charge <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> against those who buy surplus <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects, but treat <small>(at least some % of)</small> as an Investment in more Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es that will finally vest to the Consumer who paid it so that every Consumer incrementally gains <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership in the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es needed to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e all the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects they need.<br/>
<br/>
4.)</small> Secession is a <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ed right.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means any subgroup may secede for any arbitrary reason while retaining their portion of of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership that <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an attempt to address the Tyranny of the Majority.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Occupy that <a href="land.htm">land</a> with tents to begin planting and <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>ding. Will need to qualify as non-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> to avoid <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty taxes.<br/>
