&nbsp; Challenges to our business <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el may reduce our revenues and operating margins.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our business <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el has been based upon customers <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing a fee to license software that we developed and distributed. Under this license-based software <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el, software developers bear the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of converting original <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>as into software <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts through investments in research and development, offsetting these <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s with the revenue received from the distribution of their <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts. In recent years, certain “open <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e” software business <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>els have evolved into a growing challenge to our license-based software <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el. Open <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e commonly refers to software whose <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code is subject to a license allowing it to be <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified, combined with other software and redistributed, subject to restrictions set forth in the license. A number of commercial firms compete with us using an open <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e business <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el by <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ifying and then distributing open <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e software to end <a href="user.htm">user</a>s at nominal <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> and earning revenue on complementary services and <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts. These firms do not have to bear the full <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of research and development for the software. Some of these firms may <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d upon Microsoft <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>as that we provide to them <a href="free.htm">free</a> or at low royalties in connection with our interoperability initiatives. A prominent example of open <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e software is the Linux <a href="operating system.htm">operating system</a>. <a href="prop.htm">Prop</a>onents of open <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e software continue efforts to convince governments worldwide to mandate the <a href="use.htm">use</a> of open <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e software in their purchase and deployment of software <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts. Although we believe our <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts provide customers with significant advantages in security, <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tivity, and total <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, the open <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e software <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el continues to pose a significant challenge to our business <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el. To the extent open <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e software gains increasing market acceptance, sales of our <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts may decline, we may have to reduce the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es we charge for our <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts, and revenue and operating margins may decline.<br/>
<br/>
Another development is the software-as-a-service business <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el, under which companies provide applications, data, and related services over the Internet. Providers <a href="use.htm">use</a> primarily advertising or subscription-based revenue <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>els. Recent advances in <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ting and communications technologies have made this <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el viable and enabled the rapid growth of some of our competitors. We are devoting significant re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es toward developing our <a href="own.htm">own</a> competing software plus services strategies. It is uncertain whether these strategies will be successful.<br/>
<br/>
We face intense competition. We continue to experience intense competition across all markets for our <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts and services. Our competitors range in size from Fortune 100 companies to small, specialized single-<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t businesses and open <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e community-based projects. Although we believe the breadth of our businesses and <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t portfolio is a competitive advantage, our competitors that are focused on narrower <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t lines may be more effective in devoting technical, marketing, and financial re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es to compete with us. In addition, barriers to entry in our businesses generally are low and <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts, once developed, can be distributed broadly and quickly at relatively low <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>. Open <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e software vendors are devoting considerable efforts to developing software that mimics the features and functionality of our <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts, in some cases on the basis of technical specifications for Microsoft technologies that we <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e available. In response to competition, we are developing versions of our <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts with basic functionality that are sold at lower <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es than the standard versions. These competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes, <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e reductions, and/or increased operating <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s, such as for marketing and sales incentives, resulting in lower revenue, gross margins and operating income.<br/>
<br/>
We may not be able to adequately <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> our intellectual <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="protect.htm">Protect</a>ing our global intellectual <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty rights and combating unlicensed copying and <a href="use.htm">use</a> of software and other intellectual <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty is <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult. While piracy adversely affects U.S. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the U.S. is more significant, <a href="part.htm">part</a>icularly in countries where laws are less <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ive of intellectual <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty rights. Similarly, the absence of har<a href="moni.htm">moni</a>zed patent laws <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es it more <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. Throughout the world, we actively educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty rights are <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ed. However, continued educational and enforcement efforts may fail to enhance revenue. Reductions in the legal <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ion for software intellectual <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty rights or additional compliance burdens could both adversely affect revenue.<br/>

<hr/><span class="date">Nov-10-2008:</span> Subject: <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t is the original incentive<br/>
<br/>
I admit that treating <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as a reward for the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers is an<br/>
enormous incentive to incorporate.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I'm afraid it is almost<br/>
the only incentive nowadays.<br/>
<br/>
But there is another reason that people choose to organize and <a href="work.htm">work</a> together.<br/>
<br/>
The other reason is actually the true, primary and original reason for<br/>
all <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion: *<a href="produc.htm">PRODUC</a>T*.<br/>
<br/>
The actual result of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t as a Good or Service.<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion doesn't cause <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is something that MIGHT come<br/>
later if a Consumer <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s a <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between Consumer <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e and <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s<br/>
<br/>
When I <a href="use.htm">use</a> the word '<a href="profit.htm">PROFIT</a>' I am talking about the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between<br/>
the <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e a Consumer <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s, and the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er in<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ed during<br/>
that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <small>(and other, semi-hidden <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s such as interest on<br/>
loans, <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance, etc.)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporations already sort that all out and<br/>
report a final thing called '<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>', so these <a href="calc.htm">calc</a>ulations can<br/>
obviously be performed.<br/>
<br/>
When I <a href="use.htm">use</a> the word '<a href="produc.htm">PRODUC</a>T' I am talking about the output or<br/>
<a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ective of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts of an apple<br/>
tree might be, apples, shade, and maybe even some wood.<br/>
<br/>
When I <a href="use.htm">use</a> the word '<a href="pric.htm">PRIC</a>E' I am talking about the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> a Consumer<br/>
<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s - we'll assume it is in Federal Reserve <a href="note.htm">Note</a>s for now.<br/>
<br/>
When I <a href="use.htm">use</a> the word '<a href="cost.htm">COST</a>' I am talking about the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> a group of<br/>
<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> before and during <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">PROFIT</a> only appears when a <a href="produc.htm">PRODUC</a>T is sold at a <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
----<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so that was all very elementary, but it must be outlined if we are<br/>
to move to the next observation that is somehow not obvious:<br/>
<br/>
There is a special case in <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omics where the <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e of a <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t can<br/>
safely reach <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>, and where <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> can be zero.<br/>
<br/>
That case occurs when the Means of that <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <small>(the <a href="land.htm">land</a>, tools,<br/>
etc.)</small> are <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ed by a group that invested for the purpose of achieving<br/>
"at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" access to that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
Their "return on investment" is "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" goods <small>(such as organic food)</small><br/>
or "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" services <small>(such as cell-phone service)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I guess my answer to the <a href="art.htm">art</a>icle is:<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is not the only incentive, and can be replaced by *<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t* in<br/>
the special case where <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t Consumers <a href="own.htm">Own</a> the Means of that<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
All policies designed to <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e stays above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <small>(such as<br/>
destroying or limiting the growth of food, or <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e tariffs, etc.)</small> can<br/>
be phased-out in all industry where the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion are<br/>
sufficiently Consumer-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ed.<br/>

<br/>
The paper outlines some of the specific problems with the <a href="operating system.htm">Operating System</a> kernel called 'Communism'.<br/>
<br/>
But there are also specific problems with the OS kernel called 'Capitalism' that others have outlined, and that I could cover here except for the boredom it would cause...<br/>
<br/>
Just because I have problems with one does not mean I adhere to the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;To think I must would be a false dichotomy.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have problems with BOTH of these systems.<br/>
<br/>
But there are OTHER ways to organize.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many have been tried throughout hi<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>y.&nbsp;&nbsp;Others have yet to be invented, or are only <a href="part.htm">part</a>ially complete.<br/>

<span class="quot">"'While numerous experiments demonstrate how pro-sociality can influence <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic decision-<a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing, evidence on explicitly anti-social <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic behavior has thus far been limited. In this paper we investigate the importance of spite in experimental <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>-seeking contests. Although, as we show, existing evidence of excessive <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>-seeking is in theory compatible with fairness considerations, our social preference elicitations reveal that subjects' investments are driven by spite, not fairness or reciprocity. We also observe a striking disconnect between individuals' revealed social preferences in our contest <a href="game.htm">game</a> and in a standard prisoner's dilemma, rejecting the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a that there are consistent pro-social, selfish or anti-social "types". Moreover, we find that cooperation and reciprocity rates drop substantially after subjects have been exposed to <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>-seeking competition.'"</span><br/>
