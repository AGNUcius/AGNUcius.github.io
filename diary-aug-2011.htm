Within a steady <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e, <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion must continue so we can meet our re<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ing physical needs of food, shelter, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Capitalism requires Consumer_<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e be kept above <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s so the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s can be paid that <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence.<br/>
<br/>
But <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is not the only value to consider.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have forgotten about <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t.&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s with <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t?<br/>
<br/>
<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion are the end-<a href="user.htm">user</a>s of those goods and services.<br/>
<br/>
We organize <a href="user.htm">user</a>s to pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for the things they <a href="know.htm">know</a> they will need so they become the <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers for those Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, people who like milk would co-purchase a dairy.<br/>
<br/>
In this strange scenario, the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t <small>(milk for example)</small> is not bought or sold because it is already the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of the person who intends to <a href="use.htm">use</a> it.<br/>
<br/>
When you <a href="own.htm">own</a> a dairy cow, you must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, but you do not buy the milk from yourself - for you already <a href="own.htm">own</a> it!<br/>
<br/>
The same is true if you <a href="co-own.htm">CO-own</a> a dairy with 999 other people.&nbsp;&nbsp;You must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s for your % of the dairy, but instead of BUYing the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t from the other <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers, you simply collect what is already yours.<br/>
<br/>
This is true <a href="use.htm">Use</a>-Value <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
This organizational form requires neither growth nor <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>, but can operate indefinitely "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" since the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s are paid with <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t instead of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.<br/>

<br/>
By "exchange" I mean "change <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership".<br/>
<br/>
We do not need to "change <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership" of a <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t if it is already <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by the person who will consume it.<br/>
<br/>
That may seem an impossible scenario, but it is actully very common for SINGULAR <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
For example, the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of a milk-cow does not buy the milk from himself after it is <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed - he <a href="own.htm">own</a>s it already!<br/>
<br/>
We can do the same thing with MULTIPLE <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
For example, the <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers of a milk-cow do not buy the milk from themselve after it is <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed - they <a href="own.htm">own</a> it already!<br/>
<br/>
The <small>(co-)</small><a href="own.htm">own</a>er<small>(s)</small> of a dairy do not buy milk because they <a href="own.htm">own</a> those <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects ALREADY as a side-effect of their <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of those <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects.<br/>
<br/>
This eliminates one of the reasons we claim to need <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> I'm assuming that in your <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el there may be a number</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> of <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> firms undertaking <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of goods</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> and services.</span><br/>
<br/>
I envision many <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive sub-units within the Aggregate that are each <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ed by the people that intend to <a href="use.htm">use</a> the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts thereof.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if you want a community swimming-pool, then you can commit <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es or <a href="skill.htm">Skill</a>s to create and maintain such a facility.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do not care, then you do not need to be a <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>er of that sub-unit.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> These goods and services are ultimately aggregated at</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> the point of retail or "absolute exchange", either in</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> intermediated fashion, or in a peer-to-peer</span><br/>

<br/>
<span class="quot">> It is here that people exchange what they have</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed with one another through the transactions</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> that take place during absolute exchange operations.</span><br/>
<br/>
That is how Capitalism <a href="work.htm">work</a>s, but is not what I describe.<br/>
<br/>
People who commit <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s <small>(for example: milking cows)</small> would <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e those commitments in exchange for others within the Aggregate <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing commitments toward <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing things which that <a href="work.htm">work</a>er needs but does not have <a href="skill.htm">Skill</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts <small>(such as milk-cows)</small> are not <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by those that happen to have the <a href="skill.htm">Skill</a>s needed to 'operate' those <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es are instead <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by the people who need the outputs of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.&nbsp;&nbsp;The end-<a href="user.htm">user</a>s <small>(milk-drinkers)</small> are the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <small>(cattle)</small> AND the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects <small>(milk)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> People are compensated for their efforts in <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> those goods and services with claims that may take the</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> effective form of tickets or tokens.</span><br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the careful reading.<br/>
<br/>
I see what you mean here, and have called those claims "scheduling tickets" and "allocation tokens" in some of my other writings.<br/>
<br/>
But I would like to move away from that characterization toward the drastically more simplified scenario where changing <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership does not occur <small>(there is no sale)</small>, and so governments cannot interfere or collect taxes.<br/>

Hi Dante,<br/>
<br/>
This is <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the same approach I talk about, but I'm<br/>
confused when you say "not retain any <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>".<br/>
<br/>
If the people pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> to buy in bulk, then they do not<br/>
buy the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t again, after it arrives, do they?<br/>
<br/>
And if they don't <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> again, then how would there<br/>
even be any <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> at all?<br/>
<br/>
Do you plan to overcharge when collecting <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y<br/>
for the initial bulk-purchase?<br/>
<br/>

Yes, and the extension of that <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a is for those consumers<br/>

Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
I've been trying to understand how the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> might apply to the<br/>
material world and am happily surprised with the results.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual world of software:<br/>
1.)</small> An <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect is the result of <small>{compiling}</small> some type of <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
2.)</small> <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es are the inputs such as <small>{<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e-code, <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e<a href="file.htm">file</a>s,<br/>
<a href="shell.htm">shell</a>-scripts, <a href="install.htm">install</a>er scripts, etc.}</small> required to change a future<br/>
instance of that <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect type.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the physical world of <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ware:<br/>
1.)</small> An <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect is the result of <small>{<a href="work.htm">work</a>* across time}</small> to some type of <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
2.)</small> <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es are the inputs such as <small>{<a href="land.htm">land</a> and water and seeds and<br/>
animals and tools}</small> required to change a future instance of that <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect<br/>
type.<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="note.htm">Note</a>: some <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects are occasionally created by the '<a href="work.htm">work</a>' of nature<br/>
with no human intervention.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So we can say physical <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects have physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
For example, the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of a bottle of beer include <a href="land.htm">land</a>, water,<br/>
barley, hops, yeast, heated water, containers, glass <small>(for the bottle)</small>,<br/>
kiln <small>(to melt the glass)</small>, etc. - and even recursively all the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es<br/>
required to initially create the tools that created the tools, etc...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> instructs us to help every <a href="user.htm">user</a> incrementally gain at-<a href="cost.htm">cost</a><br/>
access the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of all the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects they <a href="use.htm">use</a>.<br/>
<br/>
I think I've found a way to do this!<br/>
<br/>
The trick is to <a href="start.htm">start</a> a business that can treat some % of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a><br/>
<small>(<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>)</small> as an INVESTMENT FROM THE <a href="pay.htm">PAY</a>ER.<br/>
<br/>
Treating <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er Investment causes each <a href="user.htm">user</a> to slowly gain<br/>
<a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership in the *growth* of that organization.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine you buy a $5 hamburger from such a place, but it only <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> the<br/>
<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers $3 to deliver that surplus <small>(the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers would only be<br/>
selling surplus, since the *primary* reason for their investments<br/>
would be to receive at-<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects such as hamburgers)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
The cashier would give you a receipt showing you now have <small>(within a<br/>
future vesting window)</small> $2 invested in more <a href="land.htm">land</a>, water rights, calves,<br/>
and also toward <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing wages, etc.<br/>

If we <a href="own.htm">own</a> the cattle together,<br/>
with the milk being the ROI,<br/>
then there will be no sale,<br/>
so nothing for cops to attack.<br/>
<br/>
This organizational form is called "<a href="imput.htm">Imput</a>ed Income"<br/>
<a class="ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imputed_income">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imputed_income</a><br/>
<br/>
When consumers <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <small>(such as a milk dairy)</small>,<br/>
they <a href="own.htm">own</a> the milk even before it comes out of the cows, and so don't<br/>
buy it from anyone, but simply claim what is already theirs.<br/>
<br/>
Some other interesting features:<br/>
Since there is no sale, there is no tax.<br/>
Since there is no sale, there is no <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>

Hey Dave,<br/>
<br/>
Nate Bushman mentioned he saw you.<br/>
<br/>
I've been studying <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omics in my spare time<br/>
off and on for about 10 years now.<br/>
<br/>
I've discovered something that I think is very<br/>
important but overlooked, so want to involve all<br/>
good thinkers to tackle these issues.<br/>
<br/>
I have developed an alternate <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic system<br/>
that allows for even more specialization than<br/>
we <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently enjoy and yet does not require<br/>
require <a href="pass.htm">pass</a>ing tokens <small>(<a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y)</small> and where <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a><br/>
becomes *undefined*.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here is a small riddle to help begin thinking<br/>
in this <a href="new.htm">new</a> way:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
----<br/>
<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine 1000 milk drinkers decide to buy a dairy.<br/>
<br/>
They each invest as much as they predict they will<br/>
need, and receive the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t as the ROI.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t is not sold because the people who<br/>
will <a href="use.htm">use</a> the milk are *already* the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
Because of this short-circuit, there is also<br/>
no taxes to report and no <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> to be considered.<br/>
<br/>
The riddle then, is: What is the origin of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>?<br/>

created for a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <small>(<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a class="ext" href="http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_(economics)">http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_(economics)</a><br/>
But we, the people, want abundance and would<br/>
rather not even worry about <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> and wages.<br/>
<br/>
We want <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion for the purpose of using<br/>
that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t directly: for *<a href="use.htm">use</a>-value* and<br/>
<a href="real.htm">real</a>ly don't even need to exchange the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t<br/>
after it is created if the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of the<br/>
<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es are the very <a href="user.htm">user</a>s of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We can do this by attracting <a href="user.htm">user</a>s to pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a><br/>
for an ISP connection and then <a href="use.htm">use</a> those <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s<br/>
to purchase the physical layer needed to begin.<br/>
<br/>
Since the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s are the <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, they must<br/>
<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of operation, including <a href="work.htm">work</a>,<br/>
but do not <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>, for the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is not sold.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine a theoretical situation where automated<br/>
weaving looms were made available to everyone at<br/>
the <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of that access.<br/>
<br/>
This would cause a situation analogous to what<br/>
now occurs with <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software - where <a href="user.htm">user</a>s can<br/>
get <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers to create and fix things for <a href="free.htm">free</a><br/>
<a href="part.htm">part</a>ly because it is just fun to do...<br/>
<br/>
The danger is toward those who are still <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing<br/>
in <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>rietary loom/code shops, since all those<br/>
<a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts causes <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>rietary solutions to<br/>
become less relevant and finally ignored.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> The function is to centralize the capital</span><br/>
<br/>
The way to auto-distribute <small>(decentralize)</small> capital<br/>
is to treat overpayment <small>(<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> as an investment<br/>
from that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er.<br/>
<br/>
The reason this stops the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment of tribute is<br/>
because of how that <a href="user.htm">user</a>'s <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership<br/>
will allow him to receive that <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ective at the<br/>
<a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion once he has sufficient<br/>
<a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership in the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of that <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ective.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For example: the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of a CAT5 cable and a<br/>
router must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> to purchase, <a href="install.htm">install</a>, configure,<br/>
maintain, power that <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> - but he doesn't<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span>buy* that connectivity from himself because<br/>
he <a href="own.htm">own</a>s it already.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The same is true when a loom shop <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by the<br/>
people who will finally <a href="use.htm">use</a> the outputs of those<br/>
<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es, then automation becomes a goal.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But this does not help us understand how to share,<br/>
and that is what we need to do if we are ever<br/>
to stand on our <a href="own.htm">own</a> feet on our <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="land.htm">land</a> for our<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a> purposes instead of for the usual purpose of<br/>
subjugating others through over<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>ed <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ectives<br/>
and no possibility of access to Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We will never be <a href="free.htm">free</a> until we learn to share the<br/>
Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es needed for the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of all<br/>
