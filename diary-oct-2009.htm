Is <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> the only reason for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion?<br/>
<br/>
What about the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t itself?&nbsp;&nbsp;Doesn't anybody care about that?<br/>
<br/>
What if the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s could be satisfied with receiving "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t?&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that possible?<br/>
<br/>
What if the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s were paid in <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t instead of needing to keep <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>?<br/>
<br/>
What if the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s were the very same humans intending to <a href="use.htm">use</a> the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t?<br/>
<br/>
Why are we so sure we must have a group of predatory inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s that take value from <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Clearly there is something wrong with our thinking about the <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy.<br/>
<br/>
But if we are confused about how the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine <a href="work.htm">work</a>s, why are we so reluctant to r<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>sider some of our base assumptions?<br/>
<br/>
Most would <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> that <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> appears to be a problem once it is 'large' enough; but then why can we not r<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>sider the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a that there is no other reason for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion than to keep <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>?<br/>
<br/>
We must <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers in the oil fields and refineries and the truckers, etc. by helping them to also become inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s and <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers in the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts that *they* <a href="use.htm">use</a> as well.<br/>
<br/>
If the consumers were the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s and therefore <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, there would also be no trouble with automating the <a href="work.htm">work</a> away, as it would only reduce <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
We must each have <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the material means of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion for the purpose of "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t so we can receive the outputs we each need without the 'need' to be <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ed.<br/>
<br/>
We will each need to <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e our <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s with others that have <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s we do not have, but in those cases we will only be <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing toward the elimination of <a href="work.htm">work</a> instead of seeing it as a requirement for survival.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es are also the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of the *<a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects* of those <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, so <a href="work.htm">work</a> is simply a hurdle to be overcome, not a need in and of itself when the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers and consumers are one and the same.<br/>
<br/>
If we can overcome our psychological conditioning that leads us down strange <small>(scarcity is good)</small> roads based on the faulty assumption that <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is more important that <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t, then we can solve nearly every issue that has been discussed lately here about the 'trouble' caused by automation and finally view it as an increase in leisure instead of being muddled in the illogic that causes us to believe destruction is good.<br/>

Subject: Why does Capitalism fail for most <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipants?<br/>
<br/>
It is common thinking to blame the failure of Capitalism on 'greed' exhibited by some of the actors.<br/>
<br/>
But that is like blaming the failure of an <a href="operating system.htm">Operating System</a> kernel <small>(such as <a href="free.htm">Free</a>DOS, Linux)</small> on processes that attempt to hoard all or most of the CPU, RAM, <a href="net.htm">Net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> throughput, Video Memory, etc.<br/>
<br/>
We can't blame the failure of the system on any individual <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipants because the entire purpose of the system is to withstand processes or humans exhibiting 'bad' behavior so we all have a chance to 'win'.<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to ask why Capitalism fails to inhibit the actions that eventually cause the system to become unstable and finally 'collapse'.<br/>
<br/>
What 'rules' would a corrected system require and what would it disallow?<br/>
<br/>
What causes excessive accumulation <small>(what is the <a href="real.htm">real</a> cause of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>)</small>, and how would a corrected system handle that value?<br/>
<br/>
Since <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> only occurs during scarcity, treating it as a reward for the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers tends to incent the withholding and even destruction of <a href="real.htm">real</a> solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the US Farm Bill once again <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s farmers to NOT grow for the purpose of keeping <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Arable <a href="land.htm">land</a> is held out of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion to increase scarcity because scarcity is the basis of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
But the original purpose of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is *<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t*, not *<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>*.&nbsp;&nbsp;We don't seek scarcity in small groups - we seek abundance.&nbsp;&nbsp;A family doesn't <a href="work.htm">work</a> against itself, it <a href="work.htm">work</a>s together.<br/>
<br/>
So what "flips this over"?&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are the goals of Capitalism inverted from our original goals of community?&nbsp;&nbsp;When and why do we switch gears from <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom to Power?<br/>
<br/>

<span class="quot">> How about a <a href="new.htm">new</a> city in the USA designed for walkability?</span><br/>
<br/>
Walkability is hindered by a <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty tax structure that punishes improvements instead of weighing against excessive holdings.<br/>
<br/>
This creates a 'speculation' market for physical location where inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s <small>(or even innocent farmers that find themselves encroached-upon by the growth of a city)</small> can hold large a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a>s of <a href="land.htm">land</a> *just as long* as they do not develop it.<br/>
<br/>
This is why we see so many underdeveloped patches within cities.&nbsp;&nbsp;These un<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive lots add distance to our travel and so cause excessive transport of both goods and humans.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> the deeper issue is how we <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d our <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>ology into our physical infrastructure.</span><br/>
<br/>
The P2P movement can create a physical infrastructure if we can formulate a <a href="real.htm">real</a>istic "<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <a href="recover.htm">recover</a>y" mechanism so we can begin hosting the intiatives we seek.<br/>
<br/>
This requirement applies to 'online' <a href="work.htm">work</a> such as a social <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>ing site that needs physical <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ters and <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>dings and electricity and <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers to <a href="install.htm">install</a> and manage them etc.<br/>
<br/>
And applies equally to 'offline' <a href="work.htm">work</a> such as <a href="install.htm">install</a>ing <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful plants and mushrooms on 'public' grounds within our <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> city.<br/>
<br/>
In either case we must discover a way to cover the expenses of operation.<br/>
<br/>
Governments have <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itionally taken the approach of "gather a bunch of <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y into a slush-<a href="fund.htm">fund</a>, then dole-out <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing to projects as some 'representative' council sees fit".<br/>
<br/>
A much more direct, and in my opinion, "P2P" approach that avoids some of the "Tyranny of the Majority", allowing citizens to retain much more control would be:<br/>
<br/>
1. Allow any citizen to 'advertise' any project <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>osal.<br/>
2. Other citizens that become interested may choose to <a href="fund.htm">fund</a> those projects.<br/>
2a. <a href="fund.htm">Fund</a>ing can be in the form of <a href="mone.htm">Mone</a>y <small>(Will add X$)</small> or Labor <small>(Will <a href="work.htm">work</a> to accomlish Y a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of some goal)</small> or Physical assets <small>(Will supply a roto-tiller during some window of time)</small>.<br/>
3. When any project receives enough <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing, then it can begin implementation.<br/>
4. Citizens who helped <a href="fund.htm">fund</a> the project are stakeholders in the same % that they invested.<br/>
5. Citizen do not <a href="fund.htm">fund</a> projects they do not care about, so have much more control.<br/>

<br/>
Hi Tomas,<br/>
<br/>
I would like to take advantage of such a setting for abstract observation and corrective feed<a href="back.htm">back</a> of the P2P community.&nbsp;&nbsp;We should always consider ourselves "on trial" by everyone wondering what P2P is about.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we walk the walk, or just talk the talk?<br/>
<br/>
I'm most interested in the "how would it <a href="work.htm">work</a>" <a href="part.htm">part</a> since this activity could <small>(I think should)</small> be seen as a microcosm of P2P itself.<br/>
<br/>
I would want to apply and utilize P2P principles to this very process studying how we, as peers to peers, handle the complexities and <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>iculties of <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing 'correct' group decisions - and afterward critically analyze how we *should* have handled things.<br/>
<br/>
Those <small>(maybe just me)</small> using this viewpoint would cause the appa<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> goal <small>(of delivering an award)</small> to become an arbitrary sort of vehicle <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to observe whether supposed P2P adhe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>s are willing to <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>e by their <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>utes, and to hopefully learn some things we don't understand about how to cooperate, govern, vote, reward, etc. so we can refine, expand and solidify the definition of the term 'P2P'.<br/>
<br/>
Some examples of these meta-issues include:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> The process we <a href="use.htm">use</a> to decide what needs to be decided <small>(<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently set to "criteria, selection and judgement")</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe this has already been decided by you, our "benevolent dictator" <small>(meant in the most respectful manner - only meaning you <a href="cam.htm">cam</a>e up with the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a, and we must somehow begin)</small>, and maybe that is how P2P does and/or should <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> The meaning and 'shape' of concepts such as judgement: for example, what will 'consensus' mean; is it possible for everyone to 'win'; etc..<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Legal issues such as Copyright: for example, what licenses would be allowed and disallowed, and how will this be determined.<br/>
<br/>
