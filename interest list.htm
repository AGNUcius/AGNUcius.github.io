<span class="h2">==Definition</span><br/>
An "<a href="interest list.htm">Interest List</a>" advertises the many <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ectives a <a href="net.htm">Net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> of Groups hopes to achieve.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Types</span><br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Some <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ectives are for individuals: "Fix my tooth." or "<a href="install.htm">Install</a> a kitchen floor."<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Some <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ectives are like two-way <a href="insur.htm">Insur</a>ance: "<a href="promis.htm">Promis</a>e to be my Dentist when I need it, and I will <a href="pay.htm">pay</a><small>(see below)</small> you now - so both our needs are being met."<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Some <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ectives are for Groups: "Bear the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of <a href="co-own.htm">Co-Own</a>ing this Dentist office to receive treatment." or "Support this Orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> together, and we get all the output at <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>." or "<a href="own.htm">Own</a> a bus with us and we'll <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e rides cheap."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==<a href="fund.htm">Fund</a>ing</span><br/>
<a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>ments can be made in these ways:<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> Contract to apply <a href="skill.htm">Skill</a>s "for some time or for some goal" to a Group in the <a href="net.htm">Net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> needing those <a href="skill.htm">Skill</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> Transfer <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es, such as <a href="land.htm">Land</a> or Tools, to a Group in the <a href="net.htm">Net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> needing those Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
3.)</small> 'Regular' debt-based <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency which will be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to buy Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es, or, in rare cases, to hire <a href="skill.htm">Skill</a>ed <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After some minimum a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of Interest is shown, the Group then asks for Commitment.<br/>
<br/>
If Commitment level for both Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es and Human <a href="skill.htm">Skill</a> are at or above the minimum required, we must then examine the Committed Subnet, and recursively, their Committed Subnets.<br/>
<br/>
Once this has been verified for any Subnet, the Financial transactions are drawn in legal form, and the Subnet becomes 'Invested'. <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion begins.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Deeds</span><br/>
At that moment, each Group in the Subnet issues 'Deeds' which are <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to track <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership and to show the projected returns as goods or services. These projections must be limited by the opinions of the Committed Subnet as to whether that Group can achieve those goals.<br/>
<br/>
A Deed is a projected quantity and quality of a specific <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ective within some "Window of Time" - usually in the future.<br/>
<br/>
A Deed is simultaneously "<a href="back.htm">back</a>ed by":<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> A <a href="title.htm">title</a> of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership over some % of Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <a href="co-own.htm">Co-Own</a>ed by all those with that <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ective, and that are in operational order.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> A collection of "<a href="work.htm">Work</a> Bonds" representing the <a href="promis.htm">Promis</a>es to <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a> made by <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers somewhere in the <a href="net.htm">Net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>. These commitment may or may not be '<a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ed' by <a href="skill.htm">Skill</a> Guarantors who <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e certain that future <a href="work.htm">work</a> is accomplished.<br/>
<br/>
If either of these is missing or cannot be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d, the Deed becomes 'invalid' because <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion has stopped.<br/>
<br/>
Another way to think of Deeds is to break them up into smaller pieces that are usable one-at-a-time.<br/>
<br/>
Bus Tickets, Theater Tickets, <a href="rent.htm">Rent</a> Tokens, Ride Coupon, Breakfast Coin.<br/>
<br/>
Even just a sign-up sheet that records how-much you have already <a href="use.htm">use</a>d this re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e - which effects how much you must '<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>' to out-bid someone who has had so many fewer chances. This is a complicated problem that I don't <a href="know.htm">know</a> all the <a href="part.htm">part</a>s yet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Growth</span><br/>
Growth tactics include offering "middle to upper income" people a chance to invest in their <a href="own.htm">own</a> health while saving <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y by Pre-<a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>ing for Goods and Services offered by the <a href="net.htm">Net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
These Inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s are paid in <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> must be treated as <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er Commitment and Invested by the Group <small>(or would it be the Subnet?)</small> on behalf of that <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er, with <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er receiving a Deed of that same type<small>(?)</small> - this sounds slightly wrong ...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Maintenance</span><br/>
Groups of <a href="co-own.htm">Co-Own</a>ers for any divisible Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es must decide how much to 'spend' on those <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
Any subgroup with sufficient <a href="co-own.htm">Co-Own</a>ership must be allowed to 'fork' the divisible Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
This is the "Maximum Consensus within the <a href="real.htm">Real</a>istic Divisibility of those Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es for this one Descision."<br/>
<br/>
In this way a Group can determine what it demands from itself as a whole.<br/>
<br/>
I think the % each Group member must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> is exactly the same as his % of <a href="co-own.htm">Co-Own</a>ership in that <a href="part.htm">part</a>icular indivisible Group, but this may be wrong.<br/>
<br/>
If I <a href="own.htm">own</a> 13% of a milk cow, then I get 13% of the milk, have 13% vote in what the cow eats, and must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> 13% of the re<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ing <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
If I only <a href="own.htm">own</a> 2% of a roto-tiller, I will only have 2% of vote, can only <a href="use.htm">use</a> it 2% of the time*, and must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> only 2% of the re<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ing <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
<small>(*)</small> Members '<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>' things from the Group by returning receipts that were issued by the Group at the time of initial investment, and usually reissued each round-of-<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion according to <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent holdings and <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s paid. If you run-out of such receipts, obviously you didn't invest enough. Often other group-members will 'sell' theirs to you, and can even charge <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>, but must treat all such <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er's investment in more Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When the better system is finally running, we will want to be able to commit very small a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a>s of effort to many <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ectives, and will want such investments to "degrade gracefully".<br/>
<br/>
If we accidentally or purposefully abandon them by failing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s, the Group would automatically "sell-off" enough of your <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership to cover <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s for each round-of-<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, tapering off until you have no <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in that field to match your lack of interest.<br/>
