<a href="trad.htm">Trad</a>ing labor instead of <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects would be more efficient if access to capital were not stifled by <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
It's not that <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e shouldn't be <a href="free.htm">free</a>, it's that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es are hoarded to collect usury.<br/>
<br/>
Fair <a href="trad.htm">Trad</a>e sounds nice, but is it <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly?&nbsp;&nbsp;What of the minimum wage and Labor Unions?&nbsp;&nbsp;Would your goal on an is<a href="land.htm">land</a> be the <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ion of <a href="work.htm">work</a> <small>(the continuation of toil)</small>, or would it be to minimize that <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>?<br/>
<br/>
If the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between an <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect consumer's <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e and the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> in<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ed by the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers during the previous round of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion was understood to be an investment from that consumer, then <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> would be both <a href="real.htm">real</a> growth and a continuous distribution of control.<br/>
<br/>
As <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect consumers become <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, the dangerous insanity of <a href="art.htm">art</a>ifical scarcity and the absurd <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>al of never-ending <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ment can be safely reversed to reorient ourselves with the natural course of abundance and leisure.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers would be hired to create permanent solutions, and <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency would be designed to ease specialization.<br/>

<span class="quot">"'Here are two simple principles, both of which are self-evident:&nbsp;&nbsp;I. -- That all men have equal rights to the <a href="use.htm">use</a> and enjoyment of the elements provided by Nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;II. -- That each man has an exclusive right to the <a href="use.htm">use</a> and enjoyment of what is <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed by his <a href="own.htm">own</a> labor'"</span> -- "<a href="protect.htm">Protect</a>ion or <a href="free.htm">Free</a> <a href="trad.htm">Trad</a>e" p. 280 Henry George<br/>
<br/>
I dis<a href="agree.htm">agree</a> with <a href="part.htm">part</a> II of this quote because it appears to be the common description of Capital that gives Capitalists a moral claim to keep consumers in perpetual dependence.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nature is cyclic.&nbsp;&nbsp;All things are the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t of all the previous <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>es of that matter plus all actions applied to it by Nature and Humans up to that time.<br/>
<br/>
Capital is said to be anything that is not <a href="land.htm">land</a> and is sometimes called "<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>ed Labor" because it is <a href="land.htm">land</a> that has been changed by labor.&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital might also be thought of an 'instance' of <a href="land.htm">land</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts are the output of labor applied to <a href="land.htm">land</a> and capital.&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital is also said to be the transformation of <a href="land.htm">land</a> and capital by labor.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means capital is simply <a href="land.htm">land</a> transformed.<br/>
<br/>
All things are an <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect <small>(output of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion)</small> at one time, and the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion at some another time.<br/>
