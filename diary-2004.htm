Unfortunately you've misinterpreted most of my <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>as.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> ... you said that "Locked OPEN" seed DNA was a bad thing ...</span><br/>
<br/>
Either I misspoke or you misheard.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Locked CLOSED" is the strategy Microsoft, most seed companies, and <a href="land.htm">land</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers have always <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to enforce <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity <small>(hoarding)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
"Locked OPEN" is a strange <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e of <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty enforced by the Copy<a href="left.htm">left</a> attribute of the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>, and the <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e I will <a href="use.htm">use</a> to overcome hoarding in general.<br/>
<br/>
Hoarding begins losing its power when another <a href="own.htm">own</a>er <small>(whether of software, organism genetics, <a href="land.htm">land</a>, <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hinery, etc.)</small> chooses to "Lock Open" their solution - even when the '<a href="free.htm">Free</a>' solution is not as complete.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> ... you say <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y should not be a considered factor ...</span><br/>
<br/>
<a href="mone.htm">Mone</a>y is a terribly confusing subject for more than one reason.<br/>
<br/>
What I meant to communicate was:&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been taught that our goal is to "<a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e lots of <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y".&nbsp;&nbsp;But <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y is just paper.&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't solve anything by itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;That may sound ridiculous, or simply a matter of semantics, but it is the first step in understanding that the proletariat need _solutions_, not <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp;... open piece of <a href="land.htm">land</a> for people to grow ... But to still have to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y to <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> it from an authority who will not provide any feasible sort of support.</span><br/>
<br/>
<a href="mone.htm">Mone</a>y is needed initially to climb out of our <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can get a large enough piece - probably county sized, then we won't need to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> external <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty taxes.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond that we should eventually be able to stop using Federal Reserve <a href="note.htm">note</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
Using community <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency removes yet another drain.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> I mention has to do with the desire for the community to <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d its infrastructure.<br/>
<br/>
Every community should <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e their <a href="own.htm">own</a> decisions about whether taxes should be optional.&nbsp;&nbsp;No outside force should set their stage.<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be best to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e the <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>/tax/lease-fee optional, but required for VIP access to community-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ed re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.&nbsp;&nbsp;Non <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing member would be treated as all other non members - allowed access only after <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing a <small>(possibly above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>)</small> <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>al fee.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> ... <a href="back.htm">back</a> into medieval times, having a Lordship who <a href="own.htm">own</a> the <a href="land.htm">land</a>, who policed their <a href="land.htm">land</a>s, and who collected forms of <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment from their <a href="land.htm">land</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers whose <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>es could be compared to slave labor ...</span><br/>
<br/>
You are describing the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e of most of the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we get such Low, Low <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es at our retailers?&nbsp;&nbsp;How does GAP, Disney, etc. do this?&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omic slavery enforced via finite re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e hoarding.<br/>
<br/>
My plan is to relieve the burden of hoarding so solutions may be had at '<a href="cost.htm">cost</a>' instead of <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing for somebody else to '<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>'.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> You also say "solutions are the problem", but that solutions are needed ...</span><br/>
<br/>
I meant to say: "Locked Open solutions are a problem for those that utilize <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity". <br/>
<br/>
Microsoft, Monstanto - in fact most businesses <a href="use.htm">use</a> <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity.<br/>
<br/>
The scarcity is <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial because the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t could otherwise be <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ogated for <small>(nearly)</small> <a href="free.htm">free</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> ... you wish not to contribute to ..</span><br/>
<br/>
The point I meant to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e is about human nature and dependence.<br/>
<br/>
Contributions are nice, but we must not depend on them.&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the powers of "Locked Open" re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es is the ability for others to <a href="pic.htm">pic</a>k up the ball.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can now literally <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d on the <a href="work.htm">work</a> of others.<br/>
<br/>
Humans are mostly lazy and greedy.<br/>
When you depend on another for something you need, you put yourself at risk.<br/>
If they stop <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing or begin hoarding what will you do?<br/>
<br/>
While the final goal of Communityism is a community of wealth,<br/>
The first goal of Communityism is raising the lowest rung.<br/>
When every individual <small>(or family)</small> can meet their <a href="own.htm">own</a> organic needs, wealth is available to any who choose.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="curr.htm">Curr</a>ent interdependencies in the world block those solutions - even for those that struggle the <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>est - <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing 12 to 15 hrs per day at 12 cents per hour, some as young as 9.&nbsp;&nbsp;For many of the cases I've looked into the people spend over 90% of their income on food, 5% of their income on water.&nbsp;&nbsp;They don't <a href="own.htm">own</a> the <a href="land.htm">land</a> they <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>e on, so most of it is considered slum since they don't have the time or capital to improve it.&nbsp;&nbsp;And even if they did have time and capital, they don't <a href="own.htm">own</a> it.&nbsp;&nbsp;That means the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er would come wipe them off the <a href="land.htm">land</a> if they ever <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>t up a good situation for themselves - since then they could demand higher wages while the sat home eating papaya.<br/>
<br/>
A <a href="free.htm">free</a> person should be able to:<br/>
Sit in a lean-to and die of starvation.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a choice.<br/>
Raise expensive organisms and <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d a gleaming castle.<br/>
Have a small garden and just a small shack.<br/>
<br/>
Communism requires people to "hold up the tent pole" for the benefit of others.<br/>
The community can not survive if the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers are lazy and greedy.<br/>
They must be policed and forced to <a href="work.htm">work</a> or the system fails.<br/>
<br/>
Communityism _never_ requires <a href="work.htm">work</a> for the benefit of others.<br/>
Communityism is designed to allow anyone to succeed with their <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a> alone.<br/>
Communityism is just like capitalism with hoarding disabled.<br/>
<br/>
Communityism gives everyone an opportunity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Capitalism doesn't because of hoarding.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> ... it seems the ramblings of a mad man...</span><br/>
<br/>
It is a big subject.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody has the time or interest to <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly figure it out.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your e<a href="mail.htm">mail</a> shows extreme misinterpretation of my intent.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>.. Linux environment to a lower level than they believe Microsoft environments ...<br/>
I'm not sure what you mean "to lower level".&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds like you are talking about personal fighting and pettyness.&nbsp;&nbsp;If that is the case, my only <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ement is: That is not important.&nbsp;&nbsp;I care nothing of opinions, and neither do the poor.&nbsp;&nbsp;All they need is access to solutions at _<a href="cost.htm">cost</a>_.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> ... OS war <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly be about human nature in forcing others to want what you want or have?&nbsp;&nbsp;Typical to a monarchy, or more as in communism?</span><br/>
<br/>
It doesn't matter what people want.&nbsp;&nbsp;It only matters what people are disallowed.&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor suffer when solutions are made <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificially scarce.&nbsp;&nbsp;Locking solutions open creates wealth for the community while denying hoarders the <a href="use.htm">use</a> of <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> ... individuals who are worthy of holding a corporate <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>ed IT professional's <a href="job.htm">job</a> are the only ones that matter in the war between MS and Linux.</span><br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure what you are saying here...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> <a href="mone.htm">Mone</a>y is the element which causes these issues to be brought up.</span><br/>
<br/>
The term '<a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y' is easy to <a href="use.htm">use</a> because it is such a big bucket.&nbsp;&nbsp;You must break <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y down to find what people are <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly after - and what keeps them from it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> And Microsoft could change their <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>ing plan to match that of Linux, if it becomes as big a contender as Microsoft became to Unix.</span><br/>
<br/>
Ha!&nbsp;&nbsp;Good luck!&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that what they will do?&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop charging licensing fees?&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I remember reading in some e<a href="mail.htm">mail</a> something like 80% of our revenue from licensing?&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm sure it's not small.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> They have made billions of dollars in surplus from selling their OS, having to merely sustain their OS would not destroy their company.&nbsp;&nbsp;And what happens when Microsoft releases their <a href="pack.htm">pack</a>age of Linux?&nbsp;&nbsp;It is reasonable.&nbsp;&nbsp;And I wonder if they hadn't already been <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing on it.</span><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
LOCKING licenses are adjustments to the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership rules of resouces - but can _only_ be applied by the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I LOCK OPEN organism genetics I am not stopping you from hoarding your <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am only stopping you from hoarding _my_ <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <small>(I should mention the ability to lock such things at all - to even claim them as <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty - is distasteful to me, but since Monsanto and others have already <a href="start.htm">start</a>ed locking them closed, we must defend ourselves)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you choose to <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d upon my <a href="work.htm">work</a> <small>(for instance by adjusting the genetic qualities of peach you grew from a seed received under the GGPL)</small>, then you have <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>d <small>(through the license applied to that peach)</small> to lock your changes open.&nbsp;&nbsp;But you are not forced to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a locking license doesn't appeal to you, you should find organism genetics that are still UNLOCKED.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many to be had for now, but if you look carefully at seed catalogs you will find there are fewer each year.<br/>
<br/>
If you still want to think of LOCKING licenses as _forcing_ compliance, it is worth noting that LOCKED CLOSED licenses force people to hoard.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since LOCKED OPEN is the only way to keep finite resouces from being LOCKED CLOSED, eventually everything will be locked one way or the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you hope they are CLOSED or OPEN?<br/>

Excellent point.&nbsp;&nbsp;The progression of other societies would be excellent and solving the survival problem from a personally sustaining perspective is the first step towards doing that.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a societal change that takes place after that initial growth that I will address later.<br/>
<br/>
This reminds me of the early science fiction <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a that robots would <a href="work.htm">work</a> side by side with people, doing the dangerous, tedious repetative tasks, in a way providing and <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing goods for humans who are then fortunate enough to <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>e in a peaceful egalitarian soceity of plenty.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="real.htm">real</a>ity is that robots replace people and people get <a href="left.htm">left</a> behind.<br/>

There are two <a href="part.htm">part</a>s to my answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are separated by _<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership_.<br/>
<br/>
1. We already <a href="use.htm">use</a> robotics to accomplish tedious tasks.&nbsp;&nbsp;The automatic irrigation I mentioned is a great example of this.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the citizen _<a href="own.htm">own</a>s_ the apple tree, then the solution is good for society, and nobody is 'replaced'.<br/>
<br/>
2. On the otherhand, if the citizen is <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing for someone else <small>(irrigating apple trees in this case)</small>, and the _<a href="own.htm">own</a>er_ of the trees begins using robotics to automatically irrigate the trees, the solution suddenly appears to be bad for society because the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er loses his <a href="job.htm">job</a>.<br/>
<br/>
This very phenomenon is occuring in China.&nbsp;&nbsp;The manufacturing capital of the world has seen a decline in manufacturing <a href="job.htm">job</a>s even though the output has continued to rise.&nbsp;&nbsp;This comes from increases in automation and efficiency.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's easy to see if humans do not have the opportunity to have some <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership over <a href="land.htm">land</a> <small>(actually Finite Re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es including water and other things)</small>, Intellectual <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty <small>(including both technology designs and organism genetics)</small> they <small>(the have-nots)</small> will become more and more poor as the rich become more and more rich.<br/>
<br/>
This is not neccessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is by design.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="land.htm">Land</a> and IP hoarding concentrate wealth through <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity.<br/>

Sustainable practices _can_ be achieved.&nbsp;&nbsp;They have been achieved in the past, and things are only easier when you apply <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern techniques of organic gardening and <a href="use.htm">use</a> some low-<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;They have had only limited success in the past for several reasons:<br/>
<br/>
1. The greatest barrier to sustainable <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>ing <small>(which I call personal sovereignty)</small> is <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity.<br/>

A garden is an important <a href="start.htm">start</a>ing point.&nbsp;&nbsp;This gives us the power to not <a href="fund.htm">fund</a> the wars through our food purchases.&nbsp;&nbsp;But in my mind we must have <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership over all needs and wants.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means using licenses to lock open <a href="land.htm">land</a>, technology, transportation, medication, media etc. in sensible ways so that people who are willing to <a href="work.htm">work</a> cannot be exploited by denying them their basic organic needs.<br/>

Summary: The only <a href="lib.htm">lib</a>erty "<a href="free.htm">Free</a> as in <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom" software limits is enslavement.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="rms.htm">RMS</a> <a href="use.htm">use</a>s "<a href="free.htm">Free</a> as in <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom" to describe <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts <small>(the following are my <a href="own.htm">own</a> words)</small> that have been '<a href="lib.htm">Lib</a>erated' from the <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity that the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers have <a href="use.htm">use</a>d against mankind for thousands <small>(maybe even millions)</small> of years.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You say "... you would be <a href="free.htm">free</a> to ... <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e it <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>rietary."<br/>
<br/>
The problem with <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing something <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>rietary is that the only benefit to _you_.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="prop.htm">Prop</a>rietary licensing creates <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity which, though it is an enormously powerful way to concentrate wealth, is bad for humankind.<br/>
<br/>
It may be clear that <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty and <a href="imag.htm">imag</a>inary <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <small>(sometimes referred to as intellectual <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty)</small> can be in one of three <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>es:<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Closed but not locked:<br/>
<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e is not available, but the binaries may be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d for any <a href="use.htm">use</a> <small>(for instance you may reverse engineer them)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="free.htm">Free</a>ware is sometimes in this <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;UltraHLE is an example.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Locked Closed:<br/>
Most <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>rietary software is locked closed.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e is not available and it is illegal to <a href="pic.htm">pic</a>k <small>(reverse engineer)</small> these locks.&nbsp;&nbsp;This includes my <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>er.<br/>

<a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software is locked open to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> us from hoarders who would lock it closed otherwise to create <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity.<br/>
<br/>
Locking open solutions allows the have-nots to climb out through sharing.<br/>
<br/>
People don't need a nursing <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e that disallows <a href="real.htm">real</a> solutions so the rich remain rich, while the poor remain destitute.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="land.htm">Land</a> continues to be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d against people so we enjoy LOW, LOW <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a poem I wrote about this:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The ancient magic of slavery continues unseen.<br/>
<br/>
How do get a people to do what you want?<br/>
<br/>
First you take their food, and then their <a href="land.htm">land</a>.<br/>
You tell them it's all <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the master plan.<br/>
<br/>
They simply must press on for the invisible man.<br/>
Who wants them to move stones across sand.<br/>
<br/>
To <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d a pyramid that helps no one but them.<br/>
While those un<a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ed starve and stare at the sun.<br/>
<br/>
So even those <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ed need barely be paid.<br/>
Since without such a thing there is no other way.<br/>
<br/>
To get the food and shelter and things you need.<br/>
See, you must <a href="work.htm">work</a> for <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y.&nbsp;&nbsp;You <a href="work.htm">work</a> for me.<br/>
<br/>
Since I <a href="own.htm">own</a> the <a href="land.htm">land</a> and equipment and access to both,<br/>
You must grovel and fight hope and hope and hope.<br/>
<br/>
That I am nice enough to keep you <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ed until tomorrow.<br/>
And allow you to <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>e another day in utter sorrow.<br/>
<br/>
I'll <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> you just enough to keep you alive.<br/>
And <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e you believe <a href="hard.htm">hard</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a> is how to survive.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise what would you have us do?<br/>
More hand outs, welfare, programs and <a href="free.htm">free</a> food?<br/>
<br/>
Why do you <a href="lib.htm">lib</a>erals alway whine?<br/>
When it comes time to <a href="work.htm">work</a> you call it a grind.<br/>
<br/>
We can't have <a href="land.htm">land</a> for all and personal sovereignty.<br/>
For such <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>as are surely autarchy!<br/>
<br/>
There is no such a thing as a <a href="free.htm">free</a> lunch.<br/>
So get <a href="back.htm">back</a> to <a href="work.htm">work</a> you lazy bunch!<br/>

patware:----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
FaiF = "<a href="free.htm">Free</a> as in <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom"<br/>
<br/>
You say FaiF is "for the code".<br/>
You say FaiF is not "for the people".<br/>
<br/>
But you don't have the authority to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e these claims, as you did not coin the term.&nbsp;&nbsp;You have misinterpreted the phrase.&nbsp;&nbsp;FaiF _is_ "for the people".&nbsp;&nbsp;"The code" is incidental.<br/>
<br/>
Another way to think about it may be to <a href="real.htm">real</a>ize the concept is meant to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> the <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom of future <a href="user.htm">user</a>s by disallowing the <small>(possible)</small> desire of <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="user.htm">user</a>s to end that <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, FaiF is about <a href="lib.htm">lib</a>eration, not about "<a href="free.htm">Free</a> as in Beer" <small>(which is a phrase some <a href="use.htm">use</a> to describe "Open <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e" = Open but not locked)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;A FaiF license <small>(the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> is just one example such a license)</small> does not guarantee there won't be a <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>tary charge for the software.&nbsp;&nbsp;A license is considerd FaiF if it meets these criteria:<br/>

<a href="free.htm">Free</a> software is a matter of the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s' <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software.

<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> The <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom to run the program, for any purpose <small>(<a href="free.htm">free</a>dom 0)</small>.<br/>

<span class="bullet">*</span> The <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor <small>(<a href="free.htm">free</a>dom 2)</small>.<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> The <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits <small>(<a href="free.htm">free</a>dom 3)</small>.

The analogy of the gift you give is inaccurate.&nbsp;&nbsp;FaiF software never requires anyone to give it <a href="back.htm">back</a> <small>(to stop using it)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d on the <a href="work.htm">work</a> the Community has created, you must not lock others out.<br/>
<br/>
A better analogy would be:<br/>
&nbsp; Here is a FaiF gifting organism.<br/>
&nbsp; But it comes with a license which Locks Open the genetics of future generations.<br/>
&nbsp; The offspring of this organism may <small>(most likely)</small> have genetic <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erences from the pa<a href="rent.htm">rent</a><small>(s)</small> <small>(some organism re<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e in such a way that this doesn't apply)</small>.<br/>
&nbsp; You may <a href="use.htm">use</a> and share this organism in any way except you may not Lock Closed its genetics <small>(the way Monsanto does for instance)</small>.<br/>
&nbsp; You may even sell the offspring.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only restriction is that you are not allowed to disallow future sharing.<br/>

patware:----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Public Domain is software in which the copyright has actually been abandoned.&nbsp;&nbsp;The author enforces _no_ restrictions on its <a href="use.htm">use</a> because he in fact relinquished his rights to such power.&nbsp;&nbsp;For all other software the author typically retains copyright <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>

"Open <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e" software <small>(such as a BSD or <a href="art.htm">Art</a>istic or Apache license)</small> often has some <small>(usually very light)</small> restrictions such as "You must keep these comments at the top of the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="file.htm">file</a>s", or "You must mention our name on the help screen of your <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t" or some such.&nbsp;&nbsp;The author retains copyright in order to enforce these restrictions.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Open <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e is "Open and Unlocked" - meaning you can lock it <small>(open or closed)</small> in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;Public Domain is a form of Open <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <small>(in fact _no_ restrictions)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;BSD, Apache etc. licenses are Open <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e, but may have trivial redistribution requirements unrelated to future <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software is "Open and Locked" - meaning all future <small>(released)</small> versions are also locked open.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>ed software is a form of <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
patware:----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
I'm glad we've had this discussion.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been accidentally misleading you in 2 respects:<br/>
<br/>
My understanding of the term "<a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software" was that it imposes the constraints of a license such as the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;But after carefully reading <a class="ext" href="http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/categories.html">www.fsf.org/philosophy/categories.html</a> I see the term I should have been using is "Copy<a href="left.htm">left</a>" since <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software means: "<a href="free.htm">Free</a> software is software that comes with permission for anyone to <a href="use.htm">use</a>, copy, and distribute, either verbatim or with <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ifications, either gratis or for a fee."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
Whereas Copy<a href="left.htm">left</a>ed means: "Copy<a href="left.htm">left</a>ed software is <a href="free.htm">free</a> software whose distribution terms do not let redistributors add any additional restrictions when they redistribute or <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify the software. This means that every copy of the software, even if it has been <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified, must be <a href="free.htm">free</a> software."<br/>
<br/>
So, while the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> ensures "<a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software" rights, it is the Copy<a href="left.htm">left</a> nature of the license that requires future <small>(released)</small> versions also be "<a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software".<br/>
<br/>
Strangely I never hear <a href="rms.htm">RMS</a> mention Copy<a href="left.htm">left</a>, it's alway "<a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software" he talks about.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that means he is less adamant about enforcing the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> than he is about ensuring extra license restrictions are not enforced: "The term ``open <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e'' software is <a href="use.htm">use</a>d by some people to mean more or less the same thing as <a href="free.htm">free</a> software. However, their criteria are somewhat lax; they accept some license restrictions that we consider too restrictive."<br/>
<br/>
To me this is very confusing.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> is certainly the flagship license of the <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software Foundation.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> threat is so <a href="real.htm">real</a> is because of the 'viral' Copy<a href="left.htm">left</a> requirement that causes all <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>ders to help the community.<br/>
<br/>
