<span class="bullet">*</span> Initial stages of development might have some <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>ing<br/>
&nbsp; in mobile homes and eating food the Aggregate bought in bulk.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Later, after the agriculture is <a href="install.htm">install</a>ed and <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing, the<br/>
&nbsp; system will become "self hosted", being able to operate<br/>
&nbsp; without requiring any external inputs.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Soon afterward, the system will be <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing surplus that can<br/>
&nbsp; be sold to outsiders to collect <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> If Venture Capitalists helped <a href="fund.htm">fund</a> the operation, <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the<br/>
&nbsp; <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> will be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d as their ROI.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> We may want to distribute <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> to the <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers,<br/>
&nbsp; since that is a <a href="pop.htm">pop</a>ular thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> We may we to distribute <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> to random charities,<br/>
&nbsp; since that is a <a href="pop.htm">pop</a>ular thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> But we MUST handle some non-zero % of the <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>s as though<br/>
&nbsp; that overpayment were an investment from the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> We should charge <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> during those sales, for if we don't<br/>
&nbsp; collect the <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, a middle-man will buy all that we offer<br/>
&nbsp; at <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>, and then resell it for a <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> anyway...<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> So we will charge <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> against the <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er, but we will also<br/>
&nbsp; treat <small>(at least <a href="part.htm">part</a> of)</small> that magic value as <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er Investment.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> This causes these late-coming <a href="user.htm">user</a>s to slowly gain <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership<br/>
&nbsp; and therefore to eventually stop buying that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t too.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Similar to how the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> enforces Copy<a href="left.htm">left</a> through Copyright,<br/>
&nbsp; we <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ose to create a <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty<a href="left.htm">Left</a> document enforced through<br/>
&nbsp; <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty Rights <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to apply this requirement to the Aggregate.<br/>

<span class="bullet">*</span> This social contract can be applied by <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers of any<br/>

<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Notice this is also a literal form of <a href="insur.htm">Insur</a>ance.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> These <a href="user.htm">user</a>s must cover all the <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion<br/>
&nbsp; just as any <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers do, but they do not buy the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t<br/>
&nbsp; since they <a href="own.htm">own</a> it already - and they don't sell the<br/>
&nbsp; <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t because they need to <a href="use.htm">use</a> it directly.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> The <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is not <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ed unless there is surplus, and<br/>
&nbsp; in that case the <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er must cover all the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of that<br/>
&nbsp; <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion so the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es can be compensated<br/>
&nbsp; for <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing when they didn't need to...<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> The <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er will usually also <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, according to how<br/>
&nbsp; much the "market will bear".&nbsp;&nbsp;Some % of that overpayment<br/>
&nbsp; must be treated as an investment from that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er so the<br/>
&nbsp; growth of the Aggregate is incrementally autodistributed<br/>
&nbsp; to all those willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for that growth.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> At some point, and under certain constraints, and mostly<br/>
&nbsp; to resolve disputes, subgroups must finally be allowed to<br/>
&nbsp; fork from the rest while retaining <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
Incorporating for <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t - Investing for Goods<br/>
<br/>
Let's <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e <a href="new.htm">new</a> corporations <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by the <a href="user.htm">User</a>s of those <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts.<br/>
<br/>
We will organize groups to co-buy the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es needed for <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
We will help <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers contract <small>(<a href="promis.htm">promis</a>e or bond)</small> to <a href="work.htm">work</a> in the future in exchange for food and shelter now.<br/>
<br/>
Shareholders as Consumers receive the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t itself as a natural Return for those investments. Each <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>er in the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion is <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>er of the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t in that same a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a>. If you <a href="own.htm">own</a> 15% of a milk-cow, then you <a href="own.htm">own</a> 15% of the milk <small>(assuming you 'paid' your portion of the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s)</small>. This can be true even if you <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> a small % of a 'good' sized dairy with many other Consumers.<br/>
<br/>
That leaves <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> to be treated as <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er Investment in more <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es - to become the <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty of that Consumer - causing him to incrementally gain the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es that will allow him to finally stop buying that <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t late, but instead <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s early and then <a href="own.htm">own</a> the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t as a side-effect of his <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
We will <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d <a href="new.htm">new</a> corporations that outperform the Capitalists when we finally recognize <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> as a measure of the Consumer's lack of <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership - and so must be treated as though that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er had just invested in more <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es needed to grow the collective.<br/>
<br/>
This auto-distributes <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership as the organization grows to those willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <small>(whether in Capital or in <a href="work.htm">Work</a>)</small> for that growth.<br/>
<br/>
These for-<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t corporations will treat <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as a misallocation of <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty and 'govern' that steam by reflecting it <a href="back.htm">back</a> to the <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er as his <a href="new.htm">new</a> <small>(probably not yet vested)</small> <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership in that growth.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Capitalism has achieved much for humanity, but as any business scales in size it becomes clear the goals of that body conflicts with the goals of those it claims to serve.<br/>
<br/>
As society becomes more aware of these troubles, corporations try to hide their goal of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> because we understand Scarcity keeps <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>, and therefore striving to perpetuate <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the very basis of the conflict between <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion and Consumption.<br/>
<br/>
It may seem there could be no solution since those who <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itionally <a href="fund.htm">Fund</a> <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion demand <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as a Return for the Risk they take. They are operating under the paradigm of "Exchange Value" which requires some a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of scarcity to keep <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let's re-examine our assumptions about who should <a href="fund.htm">Fund</a> and therefore <a href="own.htm">Own</a> the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
Let's look at the most trivial case of a single person <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing a fruit tree for his <a href="own.htm">own</a> benefit.<br/>
<br/>
He must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, including Wages if he does not do the <a href="work.htm">work</a> himself.<br/>
<br/>
But he cannot <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> *more* than <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>, for who would he <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> it to?<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is defined as <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> but if he does not sell the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is undefined.<br/>
<br/>
So he <a href="fund.htm">Fund</a>ed that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and <a href="own.htm">Own</a>s those means for the expected return of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t instead of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>. This was "<a href="use.htm">Use</a> Value" <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion instead of "Exchange Value". It does not benefit this <a href="own.htm">own</a>er when other orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a>s fail in the area unless he resorts to selling that which he would have eaten.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is all very obvious and might seem unimportant, but let's push the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a a bit further and see what happens:<br/>
<br/>
<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine now, instead of a single <a href="fund.htm">Fund</a>er-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>er-<a href="user.htm">User</a>, we have thousands of such inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s pooling <a href="fund.htm">Fund</a>s toward an orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a>.<br/>
<br/>
By attracting potential <a href="user.htm">User</a>s to pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for the goods they predict they will need, we can <a href="use.htm">use</a> those <a href="fund.htm">Fund</a>s to buy the means necessary for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="user.htm">User</a>s and <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers will then be the very same set. The <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t will not be sold because the ROI for the Risk is <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t itself which they attain at <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This solves the '<a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ic' case where the number of <a href="user.htm">User</a>s matches exactly the output of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
But many of these consuming inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s will want to over-<a href="own.htm">own</a> by some percentage to guarantee they have enough <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t at the round of each <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
We must do something with that surplus or it will rot.<br/>
<br/>
We can sell those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts for <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> - as much as the market will bear - but to keep the organization <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by the <a href="user.htm">User</a>s of those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts, we must treat the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as an investment from the <a href="user.htm">User</a> who paid it so they also gain <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the attached <a href="pic.htm">pic</a>ture "Capitalism.png" we see inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s in the upper-<a href="left.htm">left</a> corner <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and receiving <a href="title.htm">Title</a> to those Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
All <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s, including <a href="work.htm">Work</a>er wages, are initially paid from that pool of <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing.<br/>
<br/>
The Consumer <small>(in blue)</small> begins to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing for those <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s in his <small>(late)</small> quest to buy <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects.<br/>
<br/>
Over time, if the business is successful, the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s receive all they had initially put forward and then begin receiving the special value called <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The Consumer never gains any <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in his <a href="own.htm">own</a> Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es under this arrangement.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the attached <a href="pic.htm">pic</a>ture "Patched-Capitalism.png" we see again see inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s in the upper-<a href="left.htm">left</a> corner <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and receiving <a href="title.htm">Title</a> to those Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es, but this time the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s are *also* Consumers of the future <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t. They are taking risk for the purpose of receiving at-<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t under their full control.<br/>
<br/>
After each round of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion, the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects are not sold <small>(except in cases of surplus)</small>, because they are already the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of those who will consume them.<br/>
<br/>
The heavy line indicates there is no transfer of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, but shows the <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ers are already the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers without any need to purchase since they paid all the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and are the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers as a side-effect of their <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom of the <a href="pic.htm">pic</a>ture shows a Consumer with insufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership buying <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects late and probably <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
But in this case, that overpayment is treated as an investment from the Consumer who paid it - causing him to unwittingly <a href="fund.htm">Fund</a> the purchase and care of even *more* Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es that will eventually begin <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing and therefore provide him with that which he needs.<br/>
<br/>
This allows the organization to grow and yet remain distributed as all <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is 'reflected' <a href="back.htm">back</a> to those willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for that growth.<br/>

If Consumers were Inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s, and their Return was the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t, we could get what we need without Buying or Selling, and would <a href="trad.htm">Trad</a>e only <a href="skill.htm">Skill</a>s.<br/>

But for those not yet <a href="part.htm">part</a> of such a scheme, <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> charged against those late Consumers would be treated as *their* Investment.<br/>

<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine a crowd-<a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ed corporation where the only shareholders were the very consumers of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
Their ROI for taking risk would be to avoid <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> - since the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of an Apple tree does not *buy* the Apples from himself, but <a href="own.htm">own</a>s those <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ectives already, as a side-effect of his <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
There would no longer be "Vendor/Customer" relations to worry about since the Vendor and Customer would be one and the same!<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t would not be sold <a href="back.htm">back</a> to each inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>-consumer-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er, but it is already their <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty according to the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> they invested - whether they invested with <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y or with labor.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of a milk cow does not buy the milk from himself, but <a href="own.htm">own</a>s it already as a result of his <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the cow.<br/>
<br/>
A cooperative SELLS the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t <a href="back.htm">back</a> to the consumer-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers - thereby collecting !<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>! and coming under the scrutiny of government restrictions <small>(for example it is illegal to sell raw milk in some <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the US)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
In cases where an agent has invested more than he can <a href="use.htm">use</a> directly, he can sell that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t to agents who do not yet have sufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, but under the strict condition <small>(enforced by a Terms of Operation over that organization)</small> that any <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> collected during that sale be treated as an investment from that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er - so the organization can grow in size while avoiding the troubles of centralization and overaccumulation that plague nearly every other endeavor that even begins to succeed.<br/>
<br/>
There is no reason to worry about the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers - for that is who I am <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ing, but am <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ing their ability to consume instead of trying to <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>-up wages and avoid automation.<br/>
<br/>
Wishing the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hines would just stop <small>(as John Henry)</small> will become less and less of an option as the robots are coming to take the <a href="work.htm">work</a> away - and we can be *happy* about that if we are <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing on the right side of the equation!<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, even without robots, wages and <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> will approach zero as the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion become cheaper, since there will be no way to stop willing <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers from accessing those tools and thereby providing the solutions consumers seek.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers can invest more than they are able to consume, but it won't do them any good when the consumers already have sufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership needed to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> themselves from <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers who try to stop other peers from doing that <a href="work.htm">work</a> by blocking access to the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers cannot <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> wages through <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership if other consumers already have sufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership because <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ping wages requires the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er be able to STOP other potential <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers from accessing the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion, and why would a group stop a peer from bidding to do a <a href="job.htm">job</a> - in some cases even for <a href="free.htm">free</a> <small>(gratis)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers who invest and <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> more of the Apple orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> than they are able to consume will not be able to <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>-up wages because the other <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers will always have the option to do the <a href="work.htm">work</a> for themselves or to hire the lowest bidder.<br/>
<br/>
When the consumers around those <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers have sufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, they will not be buying the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t from anyone, but will <a href="own.htm">own</a> it already as a side-effect of their <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of those <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ectives.<br/>
<br/>
You may be tempted to dismiss this as simply a Consumer Cooperative, but this is absolutely NOT a Consumer Cooperative.<br/>
<br/>
1,)</small> Consumer Cooperatives *sell* the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t <a href="back.htm">back</a> to the <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers and collect a <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> during that transaction that a committee then doles out in a Tyranny of the Majority fashion.<br/>
<br/>
1a.)</small> <a href="imput.htm">Imput</a>ed <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion only sells <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t to non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, and only when there is surplus, and treats that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as an investment from that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er - causing <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership and control to be automatically distributed at the point of sale <a href="back.htm">back</a> to the actor who was willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for it. This system minimizes and nearly eliminates the <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ing of goods since the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es does not buy the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ective, but <a href="own.htm">own</a>s it already as a result of his <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es. The <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ing of goods will tend toward zero but does not reach stasis because of <a href="new.htm">new</a>comers into the system <small>(even just babies being born)</small>, and because people's interests change across time.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> Consumer Cooperatives are "Democratically Controlled" with one-member/one-vote.<br/>
<br/>
2a.)</small> <a href="imput.htm">Imput</a>ed <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion is far more autarchic- where any member can 'fork' his portion of the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es and secede from the union or sell those shares if a split is attempted that is finer than reasonable divisibility <small>(you can't both feed a single milk-cow grain and NOT feed that cow grain, but can divide a herd)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
2b.)</small> Each member has exactly as much vote power as he has <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership. If you <a href="own.htm">own</a> 11% of a roto-tiller and your neighbor <a href="own.htm">own</a>s 22%, then you have only half as much vote power in decisions such as "how often should we change the oil".<br/>
<br/>
3.)</small> Every Consumer Cooperative I <a href="know.htm">know</a> of is only concerned with buying <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts that were made by Capitalists.<br/>
<br/>
3a.)</small> <a href="imput.htm">Imput</a>ed <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion is primarily about <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership and control of the entire tree of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion - recursively, and <a href="work.htm">work</a>s toward a Vertically Integrated Commons where we, the people, <a href="own.htm">own</a> the farms and factories and <a href="land.htm">land</a> and water rights and all the other <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es and supporting <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es required to re<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e those things.<br/>
<br/>
We don't need to transform politicians, and do not have enough <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y to buy such changes anyway.<br/>
<br/>
All we need to do is <a href="start.htm">start</a> businesses that are <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ed and <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by Consumers and that treat <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er investment.<br/>
<br/>
Customers *already* <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion. We, the consumers, foot the entire bill. And we *also* <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> because we choose to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> late.<br/>
<br/>
But if we could organize to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> early - to collectively purchase the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts and services we need - then, we would still need to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
But since we would <a href="own.htm">own</a> the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ective as a side-effect of our <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es, we would no be 'buying' from ourselves, and so COULD NOT <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, for that final transaction would not even occur!<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is UNDEFINED when the Customers are the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers of the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
And instead of taking a stance through <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, we beg and plead with the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers to "please do the right thing" - even though the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers have NO POSSIBLE CHANCE of "doing the right thing" for they owe inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s who expect <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e be kept above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
And <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e can only be kept above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> during Scarcity.<br/>
<br/>
So we see the drive for Scarcity is caused by choosing inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s who expect <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as a return.<br/>
<br/>
The drive for Scarcity can be eliminated by choosing inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s who expect <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t as a return.<br/>
<br/>
But only Customers can <a href="use.htm">use</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t as a return.<br/>
<br/>
So the answer is to attract Customers to pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t - while using those pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ments as actual investments which are then <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ed by those Customers who benefit from the <a href="use.htm">use</a>-value of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, and never need strive for Scarcity, for the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t will usually never be sold.<br/>
<br/>
In the case where a Customer-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>er has too much <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t: the solution is to sell that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t to non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, and even to charge <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> <small>(<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>)</small> against those late comers *BUT* - here is the trick - the <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> received must be treated as though that Customer had just made an investment toward even more Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
Treating <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er's investment will allow the collective to include others while simultaneously avoiding the typical problems of overaccumulation and excessive concentration of control that cause even the most well-intentioned organizations to finally fail to meet the needs of those they were initially formed to serve <small>(the customers of course!)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
This is somewhat like a "short circuit" across the typical market.<br/>
<br/>
Where the consumers do not buy the finished goods, but <a href="own.htm">own</a> them already - even before they are completed - as a side-effect of their <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of those goods.<br/>
<br/>
If you <a href="own.htm">own</a> an Apple tree, you do not *buy* the apples from yourself.<br/>
<br/>
If you and your neighbor <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> an Apple, you need not *buy* the apples from your collective 'self'.<br/>
<br/>
If you 999 other people <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> an Apple orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a>, you need not *buy* the apples from your collective 'self'.<br/>
<br/>
This has other benefits such as:<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> Since the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is not sold, there is no chance for the government to collect sales tax.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> Since the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is not sold, there is no chance for the government to disallow that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <small>(buying raw milk is illegal in many <a href="part.htm">part</a>s of the US)</small>.<br/>

1.)</small> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t is Inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>'s Return: This is an Investment strategy that <a href="use.htm">use</a>s <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t as the ROI, and so requires the Inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s be the <a href="user.htm">User</a>s themselves.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er Investment: This is a Revenue-Sharing strategy that Invests some % of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> for the <a href="user.htm">User</a> who paid it.<br/>
<br/>
3.)</small> Investments are Commitments of <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es and <a href="skill.htm">Skill</a>s: This is a way to gather the <a href="land.htm">Land</a> and Capital needed <small>(those committing <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es would relinquish <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership to others in a group targeting some specific <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t)</small> and also to <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e the diverse <a href="work.htm">work</a> needed would be accomplished without need to fight the "simultaneous coincidence of wants" trouble with typical 'late' barter.<br/>
<br/>
By committing <a href="skill.htm">Skill</a>s *before* <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, we can <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e Labor between ourselves, and never need to <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e oranges with apples, since the <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers of the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of those <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts would <a href="own.htm">own</a> their % of the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t *already*, even before they are <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed. I call this "Predictive Barter" - where we Swap <a href="skill.htm">Skill</a>s early instead of attempting to Swap <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts *late*.<br/>
