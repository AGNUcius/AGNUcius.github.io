Subject: Why do we not choose Permaculture?<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to find out why our species has decided to move so very far away from local sufficiency toward a dangerous dependecy upon centralized <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
We have the <a href="land.htm">Land</a>, Water and willing <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers, so what is the problem?<br/>
<br/>
Why don't we grow Almonds, Avocados and Olives, in our cities <small>(where climates allow)</small>?<br/>
<br/>
Why are there not grape vines, berry bushes and spice plants in all the places we <a href="install.htm">install</a>ed un<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive species?<br/>
<br/>
I think there are some logistic problems we have overlooked and am trying to enumerate them so each can be addressed.<br/>
<br/>
Please respond if any sound wrong or to add those that are missing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> GOVERNMENTS<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> Taxation as our system of <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing public <a href="work.htm">work</a>s requires everyone in that jurisdiction <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for every project even if they are not interested.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the primary cause of the "Tyranny of the Majority".<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> There are social mores against governments being truly <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive. Some may think food should be a public service, but those with enough would not <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> - mostly because of problem #1.<br/>
<br/>
3.)</small> Even if a government were to attempt permaculture, the representatives would likely not see the benefits of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the equipment and hiring the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers, and so would hire a private business to do the <a href="work.htm">work</a> anyway - and so we, the taxpayers who <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ed the project would likely be required to *buy* the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts <a href="back.htm">back</a> from ourselves thereby being exposed to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> to those <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers and would also loose the high-level control such as if subgroups wanted to avoid herbicides/pesticides, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> BUSINESSES<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> Most businesses view everything in terms of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, so would not care about increasing local resilience but would instead weigh the decision on how much they could overcharge the customer.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> The question would viewed as a choice as to whether the business should increase their diversity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers would likely find it a silly <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>osition as they see agriculture as a strictly separate occupation that has nothing to do with their core goals.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> INDIVIDUALS<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> The <a href="own.htm">own</a>er does not have the time and <a href="skill.htm">skill</a> to maintain these more sensitive organisms and the complex <a href="ecos.htm">ecos</a>ystem they should enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> The <a href="own.htm">own</a>er does not have the time and <a href="skill.htm">skill</a> and equipment to harvest, process and <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>e those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts.<br/>
<br/>
3.)</small> There is usually "too much" of each of those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts for a single <a href="own.htm">own</a>er, and so much of the harvest goes to waste, causing logistic problems of 'mess' and also some psychological trauma.<br/>

Rough draft of Stage0 toward <a href="citizen owned.htm">Citizen Owned</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Most every home and business <a href="own.htm">own</a>er dedicates <a href="land.htm">Land</a>, Water, Tools and Labor tending non-<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive plants while <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive plants are<br/>
shunned because:<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> The <a href="own.htm">own</a>er does not have the time and <a href="skill.htm">skill</a> to maintain these more sensitive organisms and the complex <a href="ecos.htm">ecos</a>ystem they should enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> The <a href="own.htm">own</a>er does not have the time and <a href="skill.htm">skill</a> and equipment to harvest, process and <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>e those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts.<br/>
<br/>
3.)</small> There is usually "too much" of each of those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts for a single <a href="own.htm">own</a>er, and so much of the harvest goes to waste, causing logistic problems of 'mess' and also some psychological trauma.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But there are many people in need of food that *do* have the time and <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s we need.<br/>
<br/>
How to pair them up?&nbsp;&nbsp;And how to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e it worth the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers' trouble?<br/>
<br/>
We do this by noticing the profound value in the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t itself.<br/>
<br/>
We strike a deal between <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers and <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers thus:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A.)</small> We will <a href="install.htm">install</a> beautiful yet <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive plants for the same <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e as non-<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive plants.<br/>
<br/>
B.)</small> We will optionally contract with you to tend those plants and harvest the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts in perpetutity at NO <a href="cost.htm">COST</a> to you except we will retain some % of that harvest as <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment.<br/>
<br/>
C.)</small> We will optionally process and <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>e your % at NO <a href="cost.htm">COST</a> to you except we will retain some further % of that harvest as <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment.<br/>
<br/>
D.)</small> We will optionally prepare your % into advanced solutions, even fully prepared meals at NO <a href="cost.htm">COST</a> to you except we will retain some % further of that harvest as <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For example, if the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er allows us to plant 4 Pecan trees, he can receive 4 bushels of un<a href="shell.htm">shell</a>ed Pecans, or 2 bushels of <a href="shell.htm">shell</a>ed Pecans, or 1 bushel of <a href="shell.htm">shell</a>ed Pecans <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>ed by us, or 8 Pecan pies, or 4 pecan pies <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>ed by us, or 2 fancy pecan-chicken dinners, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers want <a href="land.htm">land</a>scaping; we will give them permascaping.<br/>
<br/>
But instead of a one-time <a href="install.htm">install</a>ation that the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers must then fret about, we continue service of those organisms in perpetuity and manage the outputs to whatever degree those <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers decide.<br/>

<span class="quot">> how do you translate those <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s to the community</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> in a way that shows their 'investment'.</span><br/>
<br/>
Who do you mean when you say "their investment"?<br/>
<br/>
I claim <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> must be treated as *<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er* investment.<br/>
<br/>
I say a Consumer <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing a <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> will be <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing an investment - but a special kind of investment that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s in *<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t* instead of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
I don't want the faceless 'community' to take control of that investment - for then it will be thrown into a slush <a href="fund.htm">fund</a> controlled by some committee that we will then be fighting to "do the right thing" just as we already do with almost any form of government we <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently face.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> In solving that problem, solves another problem;</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> the voting system for what to do with that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.</span><br/>
<br/>
If <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is treated as I suggest, then voting can be accomplished simply by asserting your rights in <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, if you <a href="own.htm">own</a> 21% of a roto-tiller, then you have 21% of the votes over that <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine.<br/>
<br/>
Even though I hope we can <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e a situation that looks and feels like a 'commons', I think it is important that we allow individuals and sub-groups to act mostly independent of that conglomerate so the "Tyranny of the Majority" can be kept under control. I don't want anyone without <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in my roto-tiller to be able to say how often I must change the oil, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> The only abuse I can think of in this system so</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> far is example:</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> two single moms bartering babysitting services</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> between each other at a ridiculous hourly rate</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> to generate more 'voting' points.</span><br/>
<br/>
I'm saying we won't have any such problems if we notice the direct connection between <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing and voting and then allow people to <a href="fund.htm">fund</a> only when they want that service.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="curr.htm">Curr</a>ent taxation systems take our <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s <small>(votes)</small> early on and then asks some 'representatives' to try doling them out in some 'fair' manner which can never have the fine-grained control that I describe and so we usually <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for all kinds of projects that we would otherwise never <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for.<br/>

Within the context of P2P, what are 'definitions', and what is 'authority'?<br/>

<br/>
By what reasoning do you claim the house *must* be managed as you are describing?<br/>

Maybe you are right, but maybe you are wrong, and maybe there are many other organizational forms that would <a href="work.htm">work</a> with similar degrees of success.<br/>

<br/>
The details of how <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership <small>(some would say 'sharing')</small> of <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty should be handled is at the very heart of the discussion of why corporations and governments get it wrong, and how we, the people, need to do it <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ly.<br/>

Here are some of the ways people <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently choose to share <a href="land.htm">land</a> and <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>dings.<br/>

Which would you say is closest to your vision of the best way to organize <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership in a P2P <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>?:<br/>

<span class="quot2">>> first place?</span><br/>
<br/>
I have been <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing on this problem lately, and hope to soon <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e a presentation showing how we can begin by:<br/>
<br/>
0.)</small> Determine the minimum complexity of a <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> <small>(or you might say 'community')</small> needed to host developers who can only <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> with "Commitments to <a href="work.htm">Work</a>".<br/>
<br/>
This minimum complexity is a "Basic Outcome" needed to keep these <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers sustained physically without <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing interest or <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> outside of that community.<br/>
<br/>
The inescapable <a href="part.htm">part</a>s I have <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>ntified include: housing/<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age, food/drugs, water/sanitation.<br/>
<br/>
The absolute bare-bones <a href="start.htm">start</a>up scenario could provide temporary housing/<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age with tents and food/drugs through bulk-purchase until we have the time to <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d the houses and <a href="install.htm">install</a> the organisms.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> Organize middle-class consumers to prepay with "Outside <a href="mone.htm">Mone</a>y" to buy the <a href="land.htm">Land</a>, Water, Tools, etc. needed to begin.&nbsp;&nbsp;These inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s will usually be paid with a single <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
For example, consumers who prepay for raw milk will actually be investing in the Milk Cattle, <a href="land.htm">Land</a>, Water-Rights, <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>dings, etc. needed to 'host' that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and will be 'paid' when they receive their portion of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t each day or week.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> Attract <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>ed <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers to sign contracts of "Commitment to <a href="work.htm">Work</a>" to supply the labor needed to begin.&nbsp;&nbsp;These inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s will usually be paid with a variety of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts available within the community to cover all of their physical needs.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ments to these inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s in both cases will come from the outputs of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion that takes place within that <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
So a <a href="work.htm">work</a>er might commit to <a href="work.htm">work</a> milking cattle while recieving basic meals, shelter, etc. as his return.<br/>

Even though the word "multilateral" might be interpreted as either of: one-to-many, many-to-one or many-to-many, it made me think more about "multi-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er", or what I've been thinking of as "P2P Clustering" and how many facets of an <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy are out of reach until a sort of "Critical Mass" is reached.<br/>

We *do* collect <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> from him, but <a href="use.htm">use</a> that overpayment to invest *for* him.&nbsp;&nbsp;So if he paid $5 for a hamburger that only <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> us $3.75 to deliver, Then we would be investing that $1.25 by purchasing wheat fields <small>(for the bun)</small>, tomato fields <small>(tomatoes and ketchup)</small>, spice fields, beef cattle, etc. and all the tools and wages needed to turn those <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es into future <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts - so he incrementally gains <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership to such a degree that he finally <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>s enough of the entire tree of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t that he has maximized control and minimumized <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e <small>(<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e will reach <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>)</small>.<br/>

<br/>
Most tools are Durable Goods, so to share is to schedule temporary and usually exclusive access to the entire <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine across some a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of time.<br/>
<br/>
One way to view the problem is to consider this a matter of 'utilization'.&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to keep the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine as 'busy' as possible with as few 'conflicts' in scheduling as possible so it is worth the initial investment, and so those <a href="user.htm">user</a>s 'satisfied' - <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing room for even more <a href="user.htm">user</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
Some tools are more easily scheduled than others because of <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erences in 'predictability' and also from <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence in 'priority'.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Needing the <a href="use.htm">use</a> of an ambulance is very <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult to predict and very high priority.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Needing the <a href="use.htm">use</a> of a sewer snake is very <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult to predict but only slightly high priority.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Needing the <a href="use.htm">use</a> of a concrete saw to solve a long-standing problem with your side-walk very easy to predict and very low priority.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These savings are often overlooked as being the result of not <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing Wages to <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers, but that <a href="work.htm">work</a> must be done either way, and we <a href="know.htm">know</a> the <a href="rent.htm">Rent</a>al agency or the Capitalist <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>er enjoys <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> while <a href="calc.htm">calc</a>ulating Wages as a <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>, so where is the confusion?<br/>
<br/>
For example: Let's say a for-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> business has hired <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ees to go door-to-door offering to roto-till a garden patch.<br/>
<br/>
The business <a href="own.htm">own</a>er offers the service for some fee - say $1 per square meter while <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing the <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ee operating the tiller say $10 per hour.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="own.htm">own</a>er has other <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s such as management, initial investment,<br/>
gasoline, oil, replacing <a href="part.htm">part</a>s, <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age, <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance, and maybe many<br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
But we <a href="know.htm">know</a> he is charging more that these <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s if he<br/>
is reporting a <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> - for that is the definition of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> =<br/>
"<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>".<br/>
<br/>
Now let's look at what happens when the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of the<br/>
<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <small>(the tiller)</small> are also the consumers of the outputs<br/>
<small>(the tilled ground)</small>: They must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the same <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s as<br/>
the Capitalist, including Wages to the operator and<br/>
mechanics, but they wouldn't be <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing the extra a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a><br/>
called <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> - for who could they possibly <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> it to?<br/>
<br/>
When the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es are Consumer-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ed, they could probably <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers slightly more <small>(say $12 per hour)</small> and *still* <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> less since<br/>
they wouldn't be <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing the unnecessary burden of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
There is <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a> involved in the act of organization,<br/>
but that <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <small>(wages to management)</small> must be paid<br/>
either way.<br/>
<br/>
So what is keeping us from organizing and cooperatively<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ing <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hines, <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>dings, even <a href="land.htm">land</a>?<br/>
<br/>
I think <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the problem is a long-standing belief that<br/>
whoever possesses the <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s to operate those <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hines<br/>
should be the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
But doesn't the above argument show that efficiency<br/>
<small>(as in the lowest <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e)</small> comes when <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is in<br/>
the hands of those that consume the final output?<br/>
<br/>
Another <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the problem is in figuring out how those<br/>
re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es should be shared among the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
It is a <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult, sticky situation that most people would<br/>
rather just avoid altogether because of the forecasted<br/>
in-fighting they perceive would occur.<br/>
<br/>
It seems such a group could write some 'rules' about<br/>
how to schedule access, and how much each individual<br/>
must compensate the others for any extra wear or exclusion<br/>
they cause.<br/>
<br/>
I see such a contract, if '<a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ly' written, would be the only<br/>
thing our society needs to begin down the road of<br/>
peace and abundance.<br/>
<br/>
A single <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine can be shared among a finite number<br/>
of people.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the number of consumers attempting to<br/>
utilize the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine increases, at some point it will be<br/>
impossible to fullfill those requests with a single <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine.<br/>
<br/>
If the collective <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers have the time-sharing of that<br/>
<a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine setup so that anyone wanting to <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> it are<br/>
bidding against each other, then more time slots will be filled.<br/>
<br/>
People that want to <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> close to '<a href="cost.htm">cost</a>', and are willing to lose some<br/>
sleep will <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> at 2am, while other people will be willing to "fight<br/>
it out" for a slot at 12 noon in a bid war.<br/>
<br/>
As the dueling bidders raise their <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e for that time<br/>
slot, they are *proving* that the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent number of <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hines cannot<br/>
fill peak demand, and - since that "<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" will be invested<br/>
for the winning bidder toward buying ANOTHER <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine, the 'system'<br/>
should be self-stablizing as those extra <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ments will be invested<br/>
toward another <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine until the number of <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hines is sufficient to<br/>
cover the needs of that community.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, each sub-community that develops around each of those<br/>
<a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hines can then secede from the whole if they decide to treat their<br/>
new <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine in a <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> manner <small>(say changing the oil more often)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Cooperative consumer <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is quite rare today, but there are a<br/>
few cases where a group of friends wanting a private airplane <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e a<br/>
"shared investment", and then <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> the plane from the collective<br/>
others whenever they want to <a href="use.htm">use</a> it.&nbsp;&nbsp;None of those people need the<br/>
ability to fly themselves, they can just hire a pilot and <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> that<br/>
wage as a <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> while still saving <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y by not <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Another example is shared <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of a vacation house.&nbsp;&nbsp;The<br/>
for-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> "Time Share" industry has grown around that desire, but I'm<br/>
referring to the less common case when a private group of people buy a<br/>
house that they share amongst themselves in whatever way they see fit.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I choose to apply the contract to that Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e and begin <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ing it to others for a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e that is higher that my <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of: investment, maintenance <small>(oil, fuel, wear <a href="part.htm">part</a>s)</small>, <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age,&nbsp;&nbsp;wages to any <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers I had to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>, wages to myself for managing it all, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Since I am collecting <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>, and since I am choosing to apply the contract, I must save those overpayments until I have enough to invest for all the people that overpaid to <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> the tiller during that round of growth.<br/>
<br/>
In most cases, <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers will not be 'selling' any of their <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent holdings, and so the overpaying <a href="user.htm">user</a>s will usually be <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing toward the purchase of *more* Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
Let's say, after a year or so there is finally enough <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y in the '<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er-<a href="fund.htm">fund</a>' to buy another tiller.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is a little unclear to me what we should do right here.<br/>
<br/>
On the one hand it <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es some sense to let the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers invest the <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y and then release the <a href="fract.htm">fract</a>ional-<a href="title.htm">title</a>s to that Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e to the group of <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers are generally more informed about what would be the best investment in that field, but it seems unfair and very wrong to not involve the end-<a href="user.htm">user</a> when it is his <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom we are trying to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>...<br/>
<br/>
This needs to be outlined more clearly and may need to be <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the contract.<br/>
<br/>
So, even though I think the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers would probably be <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing the investments, the more important point is that those original <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ers of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> become the <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="title.htm">title</a> holders of that new Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To answer your question more directly: I would not be 'expanding' my <a href="own.htm">own</a> holdings, but would instead be acting a sort of "growth conduit" for those who do not yet have sufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> The question is, how does selling me a share affect the value</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> of everyone else's share?</span><br/>
<br/>
Where you say "selling me a share" I will rewrite "my <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>".&nbsp;&nbsp;So your question becomes:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> how does my <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> affect the value of everyone else's share?</span><br/>
<br/>
When you <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>, that overpayment is held with the overpayments of many other <a href="user.htm">user</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
After there are sufficient <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s to move forward, those <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s become your <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in more Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es such as a new farm or another factory.<br/>
<br/>
You are not taking any value from anyone else, you are <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing your <a href="own.htm">own</a> growth through the collective purchase of the material means of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion needed to meet your <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ectives.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> Suppose there are a million shares</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by various people, and the farm sells me one share.</span><br/>
<br/>
It is probably confusing to think of this in terms of <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional 'shares' because what I'm talking about it a % of <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership shared among *only that group of <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ers*.<br/>
<br/>
There are no committees or board-members or any such bureaucracy unless that individual group decides they want to subject themselves to such a system of rule.&nbsp;&nbsp;Very large groups may find some need for variations of such self-imposed structure.<br/>
<br/>
Groups of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers using the contract are *fully independent* of each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers will decide they want the oil changed in their tiller every 200 hrs, while another group may decide they will do it every 300 hrs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> Does that mean that there are now 1,000,0001 shares <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed,</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> and everyone else's share has gone down a little in value?</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> Or do they get a dividend?</span><br/>
<br/>
If by 'dividend' you mean "will the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers receive some of the <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as a reward?" then the answer is 'no'.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is treated as an investment from the <a href="user.htm">user</a> who paid it because <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> measures a <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er's lack of <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
----<br/>
<br/>
<small>(*)</small> THE CONTRACT is the <small>(as yet incomplete)</small> legally-binding "Terms of Operation" that <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers can choose to apply to their <a href="own.htm">own</a> Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<small>(**)</small> When there is just 1 <a href="own.htm">own</a>er, <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is easily 'hidden' when the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s himself excessive wages which takes from the pool that would have otherwise been labeled <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This ability diminishes as <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is multiplexed, since the other <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers will then demand such <a href="job.htm">job</a>s be put 'on the market' to lower their <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s.<br/>

<br/>
Hey Ryan,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the response.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We need to question our long-standing assumption about how markets must <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
When you say wheat will be "under pressure" because of "high volumes" you are saying <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>es go down as Supply goes up.<br/>
<br/>
This is the <a href="econ.htm">Econ</a> 101 argument that Abundance is Bad and Scarcity is Good because of how Supply reduces Demand.<br/>
<br/>
It is assumed that we must keep <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>es above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> because of our previous assumption that the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <small>(the farms for example)</small> are not <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by the Consumers who need that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But let's open our minds to allow a new way of thinking about this.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine 10,000 Consumers buy a large wheat farm from a farmer who is going <a href="bank.htm">bank</a>rupt.&nbsp;&nbsp;They re-hire that same farmer and his <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ees to continue <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing there.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the season the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers/Consumers do not buy the wheat from themselves <small>(this is <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> from a co-op)</small>, but instead *already* <a href="own.htm">own</a> the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t as a side-effect of their <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the <a href="land.htm">Land</a> and Tools.<br/>
<br/>
Over<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is not a problem in this <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el.&nbsp;&nbsp;These <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers don't need to destroy the grain or worry about <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es at all because they are not even 'playing' in that <a href="arena.htm">arena</a>.<br/>
<br/>
They can dump the excess by selling it 'at-<a href="cost.htm">cost</a>' or even by giving it away to the poor if they like, for it does them no harm.<br/>
<br/>
This <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>e of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion does not promote Scarcity because the reward for investment is the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t itself instead of trying to keep <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e and <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> during the usual post-facto exchange of the goods.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This approach is the only form of organization I have found that does not otherwise *require* scarcity be perpetuated.<br/>

Hi Adam,<br/>
<br/>
I have been following the <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software Foundation and studying the social and <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic effects of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> since around 1991.<br/>
<br/>
I was also saddened by the absolute terms <a href="use.htm">use</a>d by <a href="rms.htm">RMS</a> to condemn the sharing of <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ware.<br/>
<br/>
The solution to this problem requires a deep r<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>sideration of why and how we <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently organize to share.<br/>
<br/>
Envision a <a href="cloud.htm">Cloud</a> which is fully <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ed, <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed and controlled by the *<a href="user.htm">User</a>s* of that <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Here's a rough sketch of the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a:<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> Approach thousands of potential <a href="user.htm">User</a>s with an <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment to prepay for such access.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> Their prepayment is <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to purchase the physical <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ware and hire <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers to begin <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
3.)</small> These <a href="user.htm">User</a>-Inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s are now <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers of this <a href="cloud.htm">cloud</a> which they control in some 'collective' or 'cooperative' manner enforced through a legally-binding Contract similar in purpose to a "Tennancy in Common <a href="agree.htm">Agree</a>ment".&nbsp;&nbsp;The details of this may be quite complicated.<br/>
<br/>
4.)</small> This, as described, should be sufficient to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> <a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom in the <a href="cloud.htm">Cloud</a>, but is not very interesting as just another private <a href="cloud.htm">cloud</a>.<br/>
<br/>
5.)</small> When these groups of <a href="user.htm">User</a>-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers begin allowing non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers to <a href="use.htm">use</a> these <a href="cloud.htm">Cloud</a> Services there is potential for abuse and over<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>ing.<br/>
<br/>
6.)</small> Because of this, the Contract must require any <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> be treated as an Investment from the <a href="user.htm">User</a> who paid it into more physical <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ware - so the <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom of ALL <a href="user.htm">User</a>s approaches 'complete' as their <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership approaches 'sufficient'.<br/>

<br/>
So what human beings are issuing <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency, and how <a href="hard.htm">hard</a> is that <a href="work.htm">work</a>?<br/>
<br/>
Remember, issuance is not printing bills or minting coins - those are done by the Mint.<br/>
<br/>
You'll need a <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter terminal and the ability to occasionally enter very large numbers.<br/>
<br/>
All Income Tax in the US is not enough to cover even just the *Interest* on these loans.<br/>
<br/>
Is there no chance this could be done a little more efficiently?<br/>
<br/>
I would certainly be willing to hold down the '0' <a href="key.htm">key</a> for a Wage much less than all the Income Taxes paid by all citizens of the US.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don't understand the argument that Private Corporations will do a better <a href="job.htm">job</a> than a Com<a href="promis.htm">promis</a>ed Government when the Private Corporations are the *<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e* of these com<a href="promis.htm">promis</a>es.<br/>

<br/>
I understand the rules of <a href="part.htm">part</a>ial-reserve <a href="bank.htm">bank</a>ing cause even more <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y to be created when I enter into a debt.<br/>
<br/>
But that transaction cannot occur unless there was some 'base' <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y to begin with - the 'reserve'.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is called M0.&nbsp;&nbsp;Who creates the M0 supply?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to find out where our <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y comes from *originally*.<br/>
<br/>
You may answer "a <a href="bank.htm">bank</a>".&nbsp;&nbsp;But then where did *they* get it from?<br/>
<br/>
Someone or some institution is declaring <small>(by fiat)</small> that <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y into existence, so *who* or *what* has that authority?<br/>
<br/>
It is like a variation the <a href="game.htm">game</a> of Monopoly<small>(R)</small> where the person "playing the <a href="bank.htm">bank</a>er" has an infinite supply of <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y that he can create for himself whenever he likes without ever going into debt and yet all the other players must borrow from him.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not trying to question the morality of any <a href="bank.htm">bank</a>er as a person, I'm trying to understand the strategy that has nations enter into massive debt when it seems it could easily be avoided if those nations would simply choose to issue M0 for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
But since the question "Why do our nations borrow" is probably too vast, I simplified to "What is the Origin of our <a href="mone.htm">Mone</a>y Supply"?<br/>

<br/>
Anyone <a href="know.htm">know</a> any of the privileged few humans with authority to Issue <a href="mone.htm">Mone</a>y out of thin air?<br/>
<br/>
This has got to be the best <a href="job.htm">job</a> on earth!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Those issuers often buy bonds <a href="back.htm">back</a>ed by "Federal <a href="land.htm">Land</a>" within each nation - so whenever a nation defaults on it's "National Debt", those issuers become the new <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of that country!<br/>
<br/>
This is a much easier way to conquer than going to war.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just trick the is<a href="land.htm">land</a> next to you into NOT issuing their <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y, then get them into debt by issuing <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y <a href="back.htm">back</a>ed by nothing which you then borrow to them!&nbsp;&nbsp;Genius!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="note.htm">Note</a>, this '<a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y' is not the physical coins or paper <a href="note.htm">note</a>s, but simply declarations of value = 'fiat' made by ... WHO?&nbsp;&nbsp;*Who* is declaring this value, and *why*&nbsp;&nbsp;do national governments borrowing it from these people instead of issuing it for the people that comprise that nation?<br/>
<br/>
There is never any reason for any government or group <small>(at the <a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>e, County, City, even Community level)</small> to be in debt, because they could always just issue <a href="mone.htm">Mone</a>y for themselves, but the won't.&nbsp;&nbsp;Weird.<br/>

He is likely wrong about some things, but I enjoy his original research and his attempts at weaving a holistic view of our past against the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent situation.<br/>
<br/>
In this <a href="work.htm">work</a> he claims the Communist <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a of the "<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ing-Class rising against the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ing-Class" has been standardized as iconographic depiction of the SUN rising - usually from behind <a href="mount.htm">mount</a>ains and/or in variations of the phrase "New Day Dawning".<br/>
<br/>
The phrase has most recently been <a href="use.htm">use</a>d by both Obama and Hillary Clinton in their <a href="cam.htm">cam</a>paigns which also include obvious SUN symbology.<br/>
<br/>
Later that day while at the local <a href="use.htm">use</a>d-goods <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>e I was looking through the VHS movies and noticed a newer version of "Animal Farm" <small>( <a class="ext" href="http://IMDB.com/title/tt0204824">IMDB.com/title/tt0204824</a> )</small>. One aspect of this <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>y is the Animals depicting the <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ing-Class rise against the Farmer representing the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ing-Class.<br/>
<br/>
To my great surprise, the front of the sleeve on the movie reads: "There's a NEW DAY DAWNING on the farm."<br/>
<br/>
What does this mean?&nbsp;&nbsp;Why and how does such a phrase appear so often?&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is in control of such choices?<br/>

Priority is created when the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion are "available to" <small>(or you might say "the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of")</small> only a subset of those who <a href="use.htm">use</a> the outputs <small>(<a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ectives)</small> of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
Under those conditions the <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e of access can be held above the true <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of that access.&nbsp;&nbsp;That <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence is, of course, <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> ceases to exist when all <a href="user.htm">user</a>s have sufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ectives they seek.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if every <a href="user.htm">user</a> who wanted to eat Salmon had enough <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the <a href="land.htm">land</a>, water rights, <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>dings and tools needed to create more Salmon, then each of those <a href="user.htm">user</a>s would have to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion - including any wages for <a href="work.htm">work</a> they did not do themselves - but would not <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> because they would not *buy* cleaned and <a href="pack.htm">pack</a>aged Salmon at the end of the season, but would <a href="own.htm">own</a> it already as a "side effect" of their <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of that <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ective.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> And when applied to "<a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty" definitions, how to prevent</span><br/>

<span class="quot">> over by a non altruistic <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty meme ?</span><br/>
<br/>
My sort of "brute force" approach to this problem is to treat all <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> <small>(<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>)</small> as though it were an investment from the Consumer who paid it.&nbsp;&nbsp;You might also think of it as a sort of pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment that was somewhat coerced from the <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er as a result of his lacking <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> Is this what is done through a <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> license ?</span><br/>
<br/>
Yes, this occurs when the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> requires the provider <small>(who has priority over the receiver)</small> allow that receiver at-<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> access to the <a href="virt.htm">Virt</a>ual <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es whenever he allows access to the finished <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ective <small>(the binary <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect <a href="file.htm">file</a>s)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> But how to apply it to scarce re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es ?&nbsp;&nbsp;How to handle con<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency issues</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> in altruistic <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>es of <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty ?</span><br/>
<br/>
One way is to create a legally binding "Social Contract" that <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers may may apply to Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ing that all <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> must be treated as <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such an enterprise should also be able to qualify as "non-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>" since non-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s already charge <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> but then try to hide those <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s by overpaying high-ranking officials and generally growing the business while retaining <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of that growth for themselves - which only further increases their priority.<br/>
<br/>
Another example where Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es are being <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ed may help clarify why this negative-feed<a href="back.htm">back</a> loop is so effective.<br/>
<br/>
Let's say two or more <a href="user.htm">user</a>s are interested in using the 'common' roto-tiller.<br/>
<br/>
They both arrive at the <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age area at noon expecting to <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine.<br/>
<br/>
They understand that *some* <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> must be paid for all of the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of initial investment, re<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ing maintenance, <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age, security, <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are all true <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s, and so there is no 'priority' yet being displayed.<br/>
<br/>
But since there is a scheduling conflict, we need a way to resolve who should receive priority.<br/>
<br/>
If we arrange for the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine to enter auction whenever there is a conflict, the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s may bid against each other causing them to voluntarily raise the <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> and create the value called '<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>'.<br/>
<br/>
If one of the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s does not want to bid, but is willing to instead wait for the other <a href="user.htm">user</a>, then he voluntarily gives-up priority because he decides immediate access is not "worth it".<br/>
<br/>
But if the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s decide that is not OK, then the bidding begins which *proves* the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <small>(the number of roto-tillers)</small> is insufficient to meet "peak demand".<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="user.htm">user</a> who wins the auction will <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> a <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> which becomes his investment toward the purchase of yet more Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <small>(another roto-tiller)</small> which means growth is caused 'naturally' by insufficient supply.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<span class="quot">> individual choices for contributions ?</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> But how to enable individual choices in a way as to avoid deadlocks in</span><br/>

<span class="quot">> it,</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> can they resolve deadlocks related to interdependency through creating novel</span><br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I think you are talking about the 'divisibility' of Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es and rights of secession.<br/>
<br/>
My vision of how to handle this would be to always allow any sub-group to break from the larger group when they have sufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in any "<a href="real.htm">real</a>istically divisible portion".<br/>

<br/>
Another reason people avoid <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ing <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s is because our tax systems punish us on both ends both as "income tax" and then as "sales tax". The <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e wants to minimize <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e amongst ourselves because it is a puppet of the corporations, and the corporations want it minimized because it causes us to be further dependent upon them - which is the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e of even more <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.<br/>

<br/>
2.)</small> The later Consumers must be treated as Inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s when they <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> so they also gain the <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty needed to eventually stop <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.<br/>

<span class="quot">> What is this process called, Patrick?</span><br/>
<br/>
I've been calling it a "Pre-<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion Bond".<br/>
<br/>
I also like to think of it as how "prepaid" goods or services <small>(for example, prepaid cell-phone service)</small> should <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly be implemented - where those who <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> become literal <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers in the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <small>(for a phone that would be the transmission towers, satellites, control rooms etc. that <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>up the infrastructure)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Our flagship <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts should be <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>amental societal needs such as food and shelter.<br/>
<br/>
I think many medium-income people would be willing to pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for organic foods.&nbsp;&nbsp;We would <a href="use.htm">use</a> their <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s to purchase the <a href="land.htm">land</a>, seeds, eggs, spores and tools needed to begin.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ROI for them would be the food itself at a very reduced <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e <small>(<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e would be exactly <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
My ultimate goal for shelter is to group-purchase a piece of <a href="land.htm">land</a> outside of any city limits so the occupying-inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s can improve their portions without being punished - since we will then have control of how <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty tax should be levied, and so can more closely follow the advice of Henry George and others to tax overallocation instead.<br/>
<br/>
I also have an <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a about <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing for their food and shelter by committing to accomplish future <a href="work.htm">work</a> such as farming or <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>ding construction or the many other <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s we will need.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will allow us to begin a permaculture based society with a much smaller outlay of 'regular' <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y.<br/>
<br/>
Since most agriculture investments do not give returns immediately, we can help the food situation at first by organizing the bulk-purchase of the necessary staples.<br/>
<br/>
The most severe form could even begin by using tents for housing while the more permanent construction is begin carried out.<br/>

<br/>
There may be a way of <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing this without going into <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional debt by having groups of consumers pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts they need while using that <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y to buy the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es required to begin. This is another way of looking at how some groups <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e bulk purchases, but has the potential for much more impact <small>(though a longer window of return)</small> when the target is a tree instead of a box of fruit.<br/>
<br/>
Though this also nearly requires the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion be already somewhat 'proven' for those investing consumers to feel comfortable handing us <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y - so to solve that problem we could find <a href="art.htm">art</a>isans that are already <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>ed and being <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive, but are becoming financially stressed.&nbsp;&nbsp;We then organize the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent consumers of that very same facility to simply <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>-off the debt begin held.<br/>
<br/>
For example, say a dairy <a href="own.htm">own</a>er is about to go <a href="bank.htm">bank</a>rupt even though his customers enjoy that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.&nbsp;&nbsp;We would approach all of those customers with an offer: if they can prepay a sufficient a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a>, then the dairy becomes their collective <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty which allows them to then recieve the milk At <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> and under their full control.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> Or when a <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>ed structure creates a "de-facto" commons,</span><br/>

<span class="quot">> De-facto "process" commons ?</span><br/>
<br/>
Dante, are you talking about how Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es are sometimes shared among <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipants without any formal <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ments?&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a great thing, but I doubt it can 'scale' to a sufficient degree for us to replace Capitalism...<br/>

You could complain to that group, but they still may not let you <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipate.<br/>
<br/>
My vision is that any group of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers applying this "Social Contract" is fully independent of any other group except for how the Contract may 'connect' them.<br/>
<br/>
This is how the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a>s with software, and I think it can also <a href="work.htm">work</a> with <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ware.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just because a group <small>(or single person)</small> puts software under the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> doesn't mean he is required to distribute it to you or to anyone at all.<br/>
<br/>
This may seem unimportant, but is actually a very <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the license because it allows developers to charge <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y for the software. Ric<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> <a href="stallman.htm">Stallman</a> was doing exactly this with the original <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> which he wrote for his <a href="work.htm">work</a> on the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="emacs.htm">Emacs</a> text <a href="edit.htm">edit</a>or.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was charging ...

<br/>
But maybe I am wrong in my thinking.&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you say we will need a central authority of sorts that can be called upon to settle disputes?
