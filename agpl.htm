&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br/>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> Affero <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a> is a <a href="free.htm">free</a>, copy<a href="left.htm">left</a> license for<br/>
software and other kinds of <a href="work.htm">work</a>s, specifically designed to ensure<br/>
cooperation with the community in the case of <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> server software.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The licenses for most software and other practical <a href="work.htm">work</a>s are designed<br/>
to take away your <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom to share and change the <a href="work.htm">work</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast,<br/>
our <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a>s are intended to guarantee your <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom to<br/>
share and change all versions of a program--to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e sure it remains <a href="free.htm">free</a><br/>
software for all its <a href="user.htm">user</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; When we speak of <a href="free.htm">free</a> software, we are referring to <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom, not<br/>
<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a>s are designed to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e sure that you<br/>
have the <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom to distribute copies of <a href="free.htm">free</a> software <small>(and charge for<br/>
them if you wish)</small>, that you receive <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code or can get it if you<br/>
want it, that you can change the software or <a href="use.htm">use</a> pieces of it in new<br/>
<a href="free.htm">free</a> programs, and that you <a href="know.htm">know</a> you can do these things.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Developers that <a href="use.htm">use</a> our <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a>s <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> your rights<br/>
with two steps: <small>(1)</small> assert copyright on the software, and <small>(2)</small> offer<br/>
you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute<br/>
and/or <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify the software.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; A s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>dary benefit of defending all <a href="user.htm">user</a>s' <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom is that<br/>
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they<br/>
receive widespread <a href="use.htm">use</a>, become available for other developers to<br/>
incorporate.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many developers of <a href="free.htm">free</a> software are heartened and<br/>
encouraged by the resulting cooperation.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the case of<br/>
software <a href="use.htm">use</a>d on <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> servers, this result may fail to come about.<br/>
The <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a> permits <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing a <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified version and<br/>
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its<br/>
<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code to the public.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> Affero <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a> is designed specifically to<br/>
ensure that, in such cases, the <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code becomes available<br/>
to the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;It requires the operator of a <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> server to<br/>
provide the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code of the <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified version running there to the<br/>
<a href="user.htm">user</a>s of that server.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, public <a href="use.htm">use</a> of a <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified version, on<br/>
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e<br/>
code of the <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified version.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; An older license, called the Affero <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a> and<br/>
published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is<br/>
a <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> license, not a version of the Affero <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>, but Affero has<br/>
released a new version of the Affero <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> which permits relicensing under<br/>
this license.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br/>
<a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ification follow.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 0. Definitions.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; "This License" refers to version 3 of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> Affero <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>s, such as semiconductor masks.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; "The Program" refers to any copyrightable <a href="work.htm">work</a> licensed under this<br/>
License.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each licensee is addressed as "you".&nbsp;&nbsp;"Licensees" and<br/>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; To "<a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify" a <a href="work.htm">work</a> means to copy from or adapt all or <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the <a href="work.htm">work</a><br/>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing of an<br/>
exact copy.&nbsp;&nbsp;The resulting <a href="work.htm">work</a> is called a "<a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified version" of the<br/>
earlier <a href="work.htm">work</a> or a <a href="work.htm">work</a> "based on" the earlier <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; A "covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>" means either the unmodified Program or a <a href="work.htm">work</a> based<br/>
on the Program.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; To "<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agate" a <a href="work.htm">work</a> means to do anything with it that, without<br/>
permission, would <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e you directly or s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>darily liable for<br/>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br/>
<a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter or <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ifying a private copy.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="prop.htm">Prop</a>agation includes copying,<br/>
distribution <small>(with or without <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ification)</small>, <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing available to the<br/>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; To "convey" a <a href="work.htm">work</a> means any kind of <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agation that enables other<br/>
<a href="part.htm">part</a>ies to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e or receive copies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mere interaction with a <a href="user.htm">user</a> through<br/>
a <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; An interactive <a href="user.htm">user</a> interface displays "Ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riate Legal Notices"<br/>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br/>
feature that <small>(1)</small> displays an ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riate copyright notice, and <small>(2)</small><br/>
tells the <a href="user.htm">user</a> that there is no warranty for the <a href="work.htm">work</a> <small>(except to the<br/>
extent that warranties are provided)</small>, that licensees may convey the<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a> under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;If<br/>
the interface presents a list of <a href="user.htm">user</a> commands or options, such as a<br/>
<a href="menu.htm">menu</a>, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 1. <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e Code.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The "<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code" for a <a href="work.htm">work</a> means the preferred form of the <a href="work.htm">work</a><br/>
for <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ifications to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;"<a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect code" means any non-<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e<br/>
form of a <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br/>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br/>
interfaces specified for a <a href="part.htm">part</a>icular programming language, one that<br/>
is widely <a href="use.htm">use</a>d among developers <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing in that language.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The "System <a href="lib.htm">Lib</a>raries" of an executable <a href="work.htm">work</a> include anything, other<br/>
than the <a href="work.htm">work</a> as a whole, that <small>(a)</small> is included in the normal form of<br/>
<a href="pack.htm">pack</a>aging a Major Component, but which is not <a href="part.htm">part</a> of that Major<br/>
Component, and <small>(b)</small> serves only to enable <a href="use.htm">use</a> of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> with that<br/>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br/>
implementation is available to the public in <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code form.&nbsp;&nbsp;A<br/>
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br/>
<small>(kernel, window system, and so on)</small> of the specific <a href="operating system.htm">operating system</a><br/>
<small>(if any)</small> on which the executable <a href="work.htm">work</a> runs, or a <a href="compile.htm">compile</a>r <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e the <a href="work.htm">work</a>, or an <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code interpreter <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to run it.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The "Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e" for a <a href="work.htm">work</a> in <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code form means all<br/>
the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code needed to generate, <a href="install.htm">install</a>, and <small>(for an executable<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>)</small> run the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code and to <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify the <a href="work.htm">work</a>, including scripts to<br/>
control those activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it does not include the <a href="work.htm">work</a>'s<br/>
System <a href="lib.htm">Lib</a>raries, or general-purpose tools or generally available <a href="free.htm">free</a><br/>
programs which are <a href="use.htm">use</a>d unmodified in performing those activities but<br/>
which are not <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e<br/>
includes interface definition <a href="file.htm">file</a>s associated with <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="file.htm">file</a>s for<br/>
the <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code for shared <a href="lib.htm">lib</a>raries and dynamically<br/>
linked subprograms that the <a href="work.htm">work</a> is specifically designed to require,<br/>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br/>
subprograms and other <a href="part.htm">part</a>s of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e need not include anything that <a href="user.htm">user</a>s<br/>
can regenerate automatically from other <a href="part.htm">part</a>s of the Corresponding<br/>
<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e for a <a href="work.htm">work</a> in <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code form is that<br/>
same <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 2. Basic Permissions.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br/>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ed<br/>
conditions are met.&nbsp;&nbsp;This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br/>
permission to run the unmodified Program.&nbsp;&nbsp;The output from running a<br/>
covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br/>
content, constitutes a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This License ac<a href="know.htm">know</a>ledges your<br/>
rights of fair <a href="use.htm">use</a> or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; You may <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e, run and <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agate covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>s that you do not<br/>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br/>
in force.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may convey covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>s to others for the sole purpose<br/>
of having them <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br/>
with facilities for running those <a href="work.htm">work</a>s, provided that you comply with<br/>
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br/>
not control copyright.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those thus <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing or running the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>s<br/>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br/>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing any copies of<br/>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br/>
the conditions <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ed below.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sublicensing is not allowed; <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 10<br/>
<a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es it unnecessary.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 3. <a href="protect.htm">Protect</a>ing <a href="user.htm">User</a>s' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; No covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> shall be deemed <a href="part.htm">part</a> of an effective technological<br/>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under <a href="art.htm">art</a>icle<br/>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br/>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br/>
measures.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; When you convey a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, you waive any legal power to forbid<br/>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br/>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br/>
the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br/>
<a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ification of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> as a means of enforcing, against the <a href="work.htm">work</a>'s<br/>
<a href="user.htm">user</a>s, your or third <a href="part.htm">part</a>ies' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br/>
technological measures.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code as you<br/>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br/>
ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riately publish on each copy an ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riate copyright notice;<br/>
keep intact all notices <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ing that this License and any<br/>
non-permissive terms added in accord with <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 7 apply to the code;<br/>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br/>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; You may charge any <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e or no <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e for each copy that you convey,<br/>
and you may offer support or warranty <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ion for a fee.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 5. Conveying <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>ified <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e Versions.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; You may convey a <a href="work.htm">work</a> based on the Program, or the <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ifications to<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e it from the Program, in the form of <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code under the<br/>
terms of <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a)</small> The <a href="work.htm">work</a> must carry prominent notices <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ing that you <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it, and giving a relevant date.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b)</small> The <a href="work.htm">work</a> must carry prominent notices <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ing that it is<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; released under this License and any conditions added under <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;This requirement <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ifies the requirement in <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 4 to<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "keep intact all notices".<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c)</small> You must license the entire <a href="work.htm">work</a>, as a whole, under this<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.&nbsp;&nbsp;This<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License will therefore apply, along with any applicable <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 7<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; additional terms, to the whole of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and all its <a href="part.htm">part</a>s,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regardless of how they are <a href="pack.htm">pack</a>aged.&nbsp;&nbsp;This License gives no<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; permission to license the <a href="work.htm">work</a> in any other way, but it does not<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d)</small> If the <a href="work.htm">work</a> has interactive <a href="user.htm">user</a> interfaces, each must display<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interfaces that do not display Ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riate Legal Notices, your<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="work.htm">work</a> need not <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e them do so.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; A compilation of a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> with other separate and independent<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>s, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>,<br/>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br/>
in or on a volume of a <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age or distribution medium, is called an<br/>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br/>
<a href="use.htm">use</a>d to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's <a href="user.htm">user</a>s<br/>
beyond what the individual <a href="work.htm">work</a>s permit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Inclusion of a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a><br/>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br/>
<a href="part.htm">part</a>s of the aggregate.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 6. Conveying Non-<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e Forms.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; You may convey a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> in <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code form under the terms<br/>
of <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ions 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br/>
<a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine-readable Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e under the terms of this License,<br/>
in one of these ways:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a)</small> Convey the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code in, or embodied in, a physical <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <small>(including a physical distribution medium)</small>, accompanied by the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e fixed on a durable physical medium<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customarily <a href="use.htm">use</a>d for software interchange.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b)</small> Convey the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code in, or embodied in, a physical <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <small>(including a physical distribution medium)</small>, accompanied by a<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long as you offer spare <a href="part.htm">part</a>s or customer support for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el, to give anyone who possesses the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code either <small>(1)</small> a<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy of the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e for all the software in the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; medium customarily <a href="use.htm">use</a>d for software interchange, for a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e no<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more than your reasonable <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of physically performing this<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conveying of <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e, or <small>(2)</small> access to copy the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e from a <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> server at no charge.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c)</small> Convey individual copies of the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code with a copy of the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written offer to provide the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;This<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only if you received the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code with such an offer, in accord<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with sub<a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 6b.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d)</small> Convey the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code by offering access from a designated<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; place <small>(gratis or for a charge)</small>, and offer equivalent access to the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e in the same way through the same place at no<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code is a <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> server, the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may be on a <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> server <small>(operated by you or a third <a href="part.htm">part</a>y)</small><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clear directions next to the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code saying where to find the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of what server hosts the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e)</small> Convey the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you inform other peers where the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code and Corresponding<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> are being offered to the general public at no<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; charge under sub<a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 6d.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; A separable portion of the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code, whose <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code is excluded<br/>
from the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e as a System <a href="lib.htm">Lib</a>rary, need not be<br/>
included in conveying the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; A "<a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t" is either <small>(1)</small> a "consumer <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t", which means any<br/>
tangible personal <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty which is normally <a href="use.htm">use</a>d for personal, family,<br/>
or household purposes, or <small>(2)</small> anything designed or sold for incorporation<br/>
into a dwelling.&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining whether a <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is a consumer <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t,<br/>
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;For a <a href="part.htm">part</a>icular<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t received by a <a href="part.htm">part</a>icular <a href="user.htm">user</a>, "normally <a href="use.htm">use</a>d" refers to a<br/>
typical or common <a href="use.htm">use</a> of that class of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, regardless of the <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>us<br/>
of the <a href="part.htm">part</a>icular <a href="user.htm">user</a> or of the way in which the <a href="part.htm">part</a>icular <a href="user.htm">user</a><br/>
actually <a href="use.htm">use</a>s, or expects or is expected to <a href="use.htm">use</a>, the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.&nbsp;&nbsp;A <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t<br/>
is a consumer <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t regardless of whether the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t has substantial<br/>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer <a href="use.htm">use</a>s, unless such <a href="use.htm">use</a>s represent<br/>
the only significant <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>e of <a href="use.htm">use</a> of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; "<a href="install.htm">Install</a>ation Information" for a <a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t means any methods,<br/>
procedures, authorization <a href="key.htm">key</a>s, or other information required to <a href="install.htm">install</a><br/>
and execute <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified versions of a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> in that <a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t from<br/>
a <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified version of its Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;The information must<br/>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect<br/>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br/>
<a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ification has been made.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; If you convey an <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code <a href="work.htm">work</a> under this <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion in, or with, or<br/>
specifically for <a href="use.htm">use</a> in, a <a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t, and the conveying occurs as<br/>
<a href="part.htm">part</a> of a transaction in which the right of possession and <a href="use.htm">use</a> of the<br/>
<a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br/>
fixed term <small>(regardless of how the transaction is characterized)</small>, the<br/>
Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e conveyed under this <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion must be accompanied<br/>
by the <a href="install.htm">Install</a>ation Information.&nbsp;&nbsp;But this requirement does not apply<br/>
if neither you nor any third <a href="part.htm">part</a>y retains the ability to <a href="install.htm">install</a><br/>
<a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code on the <a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t <small>(for example, the <a href="work.htm">work</a> has<br/>
been <a href="install.htm">install</a>ed in ROM)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The requirement to provide <a href="install.htm">Install</a>ation Information does not include a<br/>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br/>
for a <a href="work.htm">work</a> that has been <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified or <a href="install.htm">install</a>ed by the recipient, or for<br/>
the <a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t in which it has been <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified or <a href="install.htm">install</a>ed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Access to a<br/>

adversely affects the operation of the <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> or violates the rules and<br/>
protocols for communication across the <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e conveyed, and <a href="install.htm">Install</a>ation Information provided,<br/>
in accord with this <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion must be in a format that is publicly<br/>
documented <small>(and with an implementation available to the public in<br/>
<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code form)</small>, and must require no special <a href="pass.htm">pass</a>word or <a href="key.htm">key</a> for<br/>
un<a href="pack.htm">pack</a>ing, reading or copying.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 7. Additional Terms.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br/>
License by <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br/>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br/>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br/>
that they are valid under applicable law.&nbsp;&nbsp;If additional permissions<br/>
apply only to <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the Program, that <a href="part.htm">part</a> may be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d separately<br/>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br/>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; When you convey a copy of a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, you may at your option<br/>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any <a href="part.htm">part</a> of<br/>
it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>(Additional permissions may be written to require their <a href="own.htm">own</a><br/>
removal in certain cases when you <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify the <a href="work.htm">work</a>.)</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;You may place<br/>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>,<br/>
for which you have or can give ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riate copyright permission.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br/>
add to a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, you may <small>(if authorized by the copyright holders of<br/>
that material)</small> supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a)</small> Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ly from the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; terms of <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ions 15 and 16 of this License; or<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b)</small> Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; author attributions in that material or in the Ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riate Legal<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notices displayed by <a href="work.htm">work</a>s containing it; or<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c)</small> Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requiring that <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified versions of such material be marked in<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reasonable ways as <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> from the original version; or<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d)</small> Limiting the <a href="use.htm">use</a> for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; authors of the material; or<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e)</small> Declining to grant rights under <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>emark law for <a href="use.htm">use</a> of some<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e names, <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>emarks, or service marks; or<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f)</small> Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; material by anyone who conveys the material <small>(or <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified versions of<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it)</small> with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those licensors and authors.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br/>
restrictions" within the meaning of <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Program as you<br/>
received it, or any <a href="part.htm">part</a> of it, contains a notice <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ing that it is<br/>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br/>
restriction, you may remove that term.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a license document contains<br/>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br/>
License, you may add to a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> material governed by the terms<br/>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br/>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; If you add terms to a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> in accord with this <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion, you<br/>
must place, in the relevant <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="file.htm">file</a>s, a <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ement of the<br/>
additional terms that apply to those <a href="file.htm">file</a>s, or a notice indicating<br/>
where to find the applicable terms.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ed in the<br/>
form of a separately written license, or <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ed as exceptions;<br/>
the above requirements apply either way.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 8. Termination.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; You may not <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agate or <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> except as expressly<br/>
provided under this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any attempt otherwise to <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agate or<br/>
<a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br/>
this License <small>(including any patent licenses granted under the third<br/>
paragraph of <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 11)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br/>
license from a <a href="part.htm">part</a>icular copyright holder is rein<a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ed <small>(a)</small><br/>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br/>
finally terminates your license, and <small>(b)</small> permanently, if the copyright<br/>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br/>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Moreover, your license from a <a href="part.htm">part</a>icular copyright holder is<br/>
rein<a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ed permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br/>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br/>
received notice of violation of this License <small>(for any <a href="work.htm">work</a>)</small> from that<br/>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br/>
your receipt of the notice.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Termination of your rights under this <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion does not terminate the<br/>
licenses of <a href="part.htm">part</a>ies who have received copies or rights from you under<br/>
this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br/>
rein<a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ed, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br/>
material under <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 10.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br/>
run a copy of the Program.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ancillary <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agation of a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a><br/>
oc<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ing solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br/>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.&nbsp;&nbsp;However,<br/>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agate or<br/>
<a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify any covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;These actions infringe copyright if you do<br/>
not accept this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, by <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ifying or <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agating a<br/>
covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Each time you convey a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, the recipient automatically<br/>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify and<br/>
<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agate that <a href="work.htm">work</a>, subject to this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;You are not responsible<br/>
for enforcing compliance by third <a href="part.htm">part</a>ies with this License.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br/>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br/>
organization, or merging organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;If <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agation of a covered<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a> results from an entity transaction, each <a href="part.htm">part</a>y to that<br/>
transaction who receives a copy of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> also receives whatever<br/>
licenses to the <a href="work.htm">work</a> the <a href="part.htm">part</a>y's predecessor in interest had or could<br/>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br/>
Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> from the predecessor in interest, if<br/>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br/>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, you may<br/>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br/>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br/>
<small>(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)</small> alleging that<br/>
any patent claim is infringed by <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing, using, selling, offering for<br/>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 11. Patents.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes <a href="use.htm">use</a> under this<br/>
License of the Program or a <a href="work.htm">work</a> on which the Program is based.&nbsp;&nbsp;The<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a> thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ed or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br/>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br/>
by this License, of <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing, using, or selling its contributor version,<br/>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br/>
consequence of further <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ification of the contributor version.&nbsp;&nbsp;For<br/>
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br/>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br/>
this License.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-<a href="free.htm">free</a><br/>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br/>
<a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e, <a href="use.htm">use</a>, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify and<br/>
<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agate the contents of its contributor version.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br/>
<a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br/>
<small>(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br/>
sue for patent infringement)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;To "grant" such a patent license to a<br/>
<a href="part.htm">part</a>y means to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e such an <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment or commitment not to enforce a<br/>
patent against the <a href="part.htm">part</a>y.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; If you convey a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, <a href="know.htm">know</a>ingly relying on a patent license,<br/>
and the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> is not available for anyone<br/>
to copy, <a href="free.htm">free</a> of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br/>
publicly available <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> server or other readily accessible means,<br/>
then you must either <small>(1)</small> cause the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e to be so<br/>
available, or <small>(2)</small> arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br/>
patent license for this <a href="part.htm">part</a>icular <a href="work.htm">work</a>, or <small>(3)</small> arrange, in a manner<br/>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br/>
license to downstream recipients.&nbsp;&nbsp;"<a href="know.htm">Know</a>ingly relying" means you have<br/>
actual <a href="know.htm">know</a>ledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br/>
covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> in a country, or your recipient's <a href="use.htm">use</a> of the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a><br/>
in a country, would infringe one or more <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>ntifiable patents in that<br/>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br/>
arrangement, you convey, or <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agate by procuring conveyance of, a<br/>
covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and grant a patent license to some of the <a href="part.htm">part</a>ies<br/>
receiving the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> authorizing them to <a href="use.htm">use</a>, <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agate, <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify<br/>
or convey a specific copy of the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, then the patent license<br/>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a> and <a href="work.htm">work</a>s based on it.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br/>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br/>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br/>
specifically granted under this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may not convey a covered<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a> if you are a <a href="part.htm">part</a>y to an arrangement with a third <a href="part.htm">part</a>y that is<br/>
in the business of distributing software, under which you <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment<br/>
to the third <a href="part.htm">part</a>y based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br/>
the <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and under which the third <a href="part.htm">part</a>y grants, to any of the<br/>
<a href="part.htm">part</a>ies who would receive the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> from you, a discriminatory<br/>
patent license <small>(a)</small> in connection with copies of the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a><br/>
conveyed by you <small>(or copies made from those copies)</small>, or <small>(b)</small> primarily<br/>
for and in connection with specific <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts or compilations that<br/>
contain the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br/>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br/>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br/>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 12. No Surrender of Others' <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; If conditions are imposed on you <small>(whether by court order, <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment or<br/>
otherwise)</small> that con<a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ict the conditions of this License, they do not<br/>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you cannot convey a<br/>
covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br/>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br/>
not convey it at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if you <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> to terms that obligate you<br/>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br/>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br/>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 13. <a href="remot.htm">Remot</a>e <a href="net.htm">Net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> Interaction; <a href="use.htm">Use</a> with the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify the<br/>
Program, your <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified version must prominently offer all <a href="user.htm">user</a>s<br/>
interacting with it <a href="remot.htm">remot</a>ely through a <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> <small>(if your version<br/>
supports such interaction)</small> an opportunity to receive the Corresponding<br/>
<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e of your version by providing access to the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e<br/>
from a <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> server at no charge, through some standard or customary<br/>
means of facilitating copying of software.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e<br/>
shall include the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e for any <a href="work.htm">work</a> covered by version 3<br/>
of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a> that is incorporated pursuant to the<br/>
following paragraph.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br/>
permission to link or combine any covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> with a <a href="work.htm">work</a> licensed<br/>
under version 3 of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a> into a single<br/>
combined <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and to convey the resulting <a href="work.htm">work</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of this<br/>
License will continue to apply to the <a href="part.htm">part</a> which is the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>,<br/>
but the <a href="work.htm">work</a> with which it is combined will remain governed by version<br/>
3 of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 14. Revised Versions of this License.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br/>
the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> Affero <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a> from time to time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such new versions<br/>
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>er in detail to<br/>
address new problems or concerns.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the<br/>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> Affero General<br/>
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br/>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br/>
version or of any later version published by the <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software<br/>
Foundation.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br/>
<a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> Affero <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a>, you may choose any version ever published<br/>
by the <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software Foundation.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br/>
versions of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> Affero <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a> can be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d, that proxy's<br/>
public <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br/>
to choose that version for the Program.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Later license versions may give you additional or <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a><br/>
permissions.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br/>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br/>
later version.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br/>
APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp;&nbsp;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE <a href="stat.htm">STAT</a>ED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br/>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER <a href="part.htm">PART</a>IES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br/>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br/>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A <a href="part.htm">PART</a>ICULAR<br/>
PURPOSE.&nbsp;&nbsp;THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br/>
IS WITH YOU.&nbsp;&nbsp;SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE <a href="cost.htm">COST</a> OF<br/>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 16. Limitation of Liability.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR <a href="agree.htm">AGREE</a>D TO IN WRITING<br/>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER <a href="part.htm">PART</a>Y WHO <a href="mod.htm">MOD</a>IFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br/>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br/>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br/>
<a href="use.htm">USE</a> OR INABILITY TO <a href="use.htm">USE</a> THE PROGRAM <small>(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br/>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br/>
<a href="part.htm">PART</a>IES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS)</small>,<br/>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER <a href="part.htm">PART</a>Y HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br/>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 17. Interpretation of <a href="sect.htm">Sect</a>ions 15 and 16.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br/>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br/>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br/>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br/>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br/>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br/>
possible <a href="use.htm">use</a> to the public, the best way to achieve this is to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e it<br/>
<a href="free.htm">free</a> software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; To do so, attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is safest<br/>
to attach them to the <a href="start.htm">start</a> of each <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="file.htm">file</a> to most effectively<br/>
<a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e the exclusion of warranty; and each <a href="file.htm">file</a> should have at least<br/>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a of what it does.><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright <small>(C)</small> &lt;year>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;name of author><br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is <a href="free.htm">free</a> software: you can redistribute it and/or <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it under the terms of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> Affero <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a> as published by<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <small>(at your option)</small> any later version.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This program is distributed in the hope that it will be <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A <a href="part.htm">PART</a>ICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp;&nbsp;See the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> Affero <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a> for more details.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should have received a copy of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> Affero <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along with this program.&nbsp;&nbsp;If not, see &lt;<a class="ext" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.</a><br/>
<br/>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper <a href="mail.htm">mail</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; If your software can interact with <a href="user.htm">user</a>s <a href="remot.htm">remot</a>ely through a <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter<br/>
<a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>, you should also <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e sure that it provides a way for <a href="user.htm">user</a>s to<br/>
get its <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if your program is a <a href="web.htm">web</a> application, its<br/>
interface could display a "<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e" link that leads <a href="user.htm">user</a>s to an archive<br/>
of the code.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many ways you could offer <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e, and <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a><br/>
solutions will be better for <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> programs; see <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 13 for the<br/>
specific requirements.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; You should also get your <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>er <small>(if you <a href="work.htm">work</a> as a programmer)</small> or school,<br/>
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br/>
