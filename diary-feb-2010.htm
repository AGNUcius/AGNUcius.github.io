Aside from any technical issues, what do you see as being wrong with how things are done now?<br/>
<br/>
In other words, assuming centralization has *some* benefits, why does it not serve us in the way we expect?<br/>
<br/>
As an example: What is wrong with G<a href="mail.htm">mail</a>?&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand they snoop on you, limit you, report you to 'authorities', etc., but why do *they* do those things to *us*, and why can *we* not get-together to <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> those datacenters for our collective 'self' so that we <small>(as a group)</small> finally have control?<br/>
<br/>
It appears to me the problem is that even when attempting to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion so-called "community <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed", we do not understand how to handle growth caused by <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, and so ignorantly accumulate the control of those investments into the hands of the few that began the venture while leaving those who paid for the growth without any <a href="real.htm">real</a> control of their <a href="own.htm">own</a>.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
These consumers are <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing a <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>, so we <a href="know.htm">know</a> the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers are collecting <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers are using THE CONTRACT which requires a consumer's overpayment be treated as HIS investment in more Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
There is sufficient <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion in the area for all those <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing consumers, but the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es are not <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by those consumers.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of those Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es obviously have more <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion than they can <a href="use.htm">use</a> directly, for that is why they are selling the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts.&nbsp;&nbsp;During such conditions, the most <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>al route <small>(and I think will be the most common for 'over<a href="proper.htm">proper</a>tied' <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers)</small> would be some of the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers choosing to sell some of their extra Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es to those under<a href="proper.htm">proper</a>tied customers.<br/>
<br/>
But, <small>(in what I think will be a rare case)</small>, if none of the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers are willing to sell any of their Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es even though they clearly have more than they can <a href="use.htm">use</a> for themselves, there will be no recourse but to buy or <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d even *more* Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es for the new <a href="user.htm">user</a>s - paid for by the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s - until every <a href="user.htm">user</a> has sufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
For it is not just that we need sufficient <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, but the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion must be distributed to those who are willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for it, else <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom is not complete.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When a <a href="user.htm">user</a> finally has sufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership toward some <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ective, he no longer buys that type of <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect from someone else because he already <a href="own.htm">own</a>s it as a side-effect of his <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty in it's Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
An <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es is also the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of all potential <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ectives of those <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
For example, when you <a href="own.htm">own</a> a car, you don't buy the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ective "get across town" from somebody else, you <a href="own.htm">own</a> it as a side-effect of <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing for all the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of buying, maintaining, <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>ing and operating that Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
When you <a href="own.htm">own</a> an apple tree, you don't buy the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects called "apples" from somebody else, you <a href="own.htm">own</a> them even before the blossoms have formed - as a side-effect of <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing for all the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of that Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e.<br/>

Since <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es is <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently very far from being in the hands of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect <a href="user.htm">User</a>s, <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty will need to change hands a great deal at first as farms and factories are slowly bought by groups using the contract.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
As a collective whole, we have had for decades enough agricultural technology, if applied, could supply all humans many times over.<br/>
<br/>
But those who <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently <a href="own.htm">own</a> the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of our food, medicine, <a href="soap.htm">soap</a>, cloth, etc. cannot allow that those <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es to be utilized to their full potential, for that would cause <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es to drop.<br/>
<br/>
And they can't let <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es drop because their inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s expect <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as their return.<br/>
<br/>
These organizations grow so large they are able to purchase legislation such as the US Farm Bill that once again <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s farmers to NOT grow in areas that must be provably arable.<br/>
<br/>
This occurs because Capitalists treat <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> in such a way that it becomes a "positive feed<a href="back.htm">back</a> loop" - promoting actions that increase <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> even further, and subjugating the <a href="user.htm">user</a> to keep those measures in place.<br/>
<br/>
Our species is trivially able to support itself if only we could organize in such a way as to allow <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e to reach <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> in a 'safe' manner so we are not forever trying to '<a href="protect.htm">protect</a>' <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e by <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ping up <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>es and Wages through <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity enforced by tarrifs and Unions etc.<br/>
<br/>
The usual opposite to that is to claim <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e must be made '<a href="free.htm">free</a>' using instruments such as NAFTA, CAFTA, etc.<br/>
<br/>
But that doesn't <a href="work.htm">work</a> either, because the goal of those corporations is wrong from the beginning.&nbsp;&nbsp;They dont' care about <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t; they care only about <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>...<br/>
<br/>
Within Capitalism, the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es are usually under obligation to inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s who expect them to treat <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as the return for taking risk.<br/>
<br/>
But what about the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t itself?&nbsp;&nbsp;We can <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s with <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion if those inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s are also *<a href="user.htm">user</a>s* that will be satisfied with "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" goods and services under their full control.<br/>
<br/>
So how can we <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s if we intend to <a href="use.htm">use</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> for another purpose?&nbsp;&nbsp;One way is to attract Consumers to pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for a return of *<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t* instead.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone will have "high-level" control of their milk, eggs, bread, medicine, <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>ing, transportation, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will have those things "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>".&nbsp;&nbsp;How much does it *<a href="real.htm">real</a>ly* <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> to send a photo from a cell-phone?<br/>

The <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> gains <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es needed for the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of each type of <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect he consumes.&nbsp;&nbsp;And as his <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership approaches 'sufficient', his need to purchase <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects approaches zero.<br/>
<br/>
For example: when the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> has enough <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in Peach trees needed to supply himself with all the peaches he will <a href="use.htm">use</a> during that season, then he no longer buys Peaches from someone else, but is instead already <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of his % of Peaches that fell from his tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;He must pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of dealing with that fruit, but does not <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>, for who would he <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> it to?<br/>
<br/>
And since he no longer <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> for that specific <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ective, he will no longer be 'growing' in that regard.<br/>
<br/>
His investments have fallen to zero because his <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> fell to zero; and his <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> fell to zero because he gained sufficient <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty in those Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er slowly gains <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty in Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es as the <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> he paid is invested for him.<br/>
<br/>
While <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is treated as <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er investment, <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>ers gain <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty in Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es until they have enough of that type that no longer need to grow in that regard.<br/>
<br/>
Growth will approach zero as <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> approaches zero,<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> will approach zero as <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty approaches 'sufficient' for each type of <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ective.<br/>
<a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty will approach 'sufficient' if <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is treated as a <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er's investment.<br/>
<br/>
Growth will auto-level and stabilize in a natural manner when the goal is the outputs of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion instead of the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e and <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>

<span class="quot">> But what happens when you get <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> but further expansion</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> is not desirable?</span><br/>
<br/>
Let's look at the most simple case where 1 person <a href="own.htm">own</a>s some Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e and applies THE CONTRACT* to that <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine I <a href="own.htm">own</a> a more expensive roto-tiller.<br/>
<br/>
I choose to apply the contract to that Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e and begin <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ing it to others for a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e that is higher that my <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of: investment, maintenance <small>(oil, fuel, wear <a href="part.htm">part</a>s)</small>, <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age,&nbsp;&nbsp;wages to any <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers I had to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>, wages to myself for managing it all, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Since I am collecting <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>**, and since I am choosing to apply the contract, I must save those overpayments until I have enough to invest for all the people that overpaid to <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> the tiller during that round of growth.<br/>
<br/>
In most cases, <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers will not be 'selling' any of their <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent holdings, and so the overpaying <a href="user.htm">user</a>s will usually be <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing toward the purchase of *more* Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
Let's say, after a year or so there is finally enough <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y in the '<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er-<a href="fund.htm">fund</a>' to buy another tiller.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is a little unclear to me what we should do right here.<br/>
<br/>
On the one hand it <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es some sense to let the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers invest the <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y and then release the <a href="fract.htm">fract</a>ional-<a href="title.htm">title</a>s to that Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e to the group of <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers are generally more informed about what would be the best investment in that field, but it seems unfair and very wrong to not involve the end-<a href="user.htm">user</a> when it is his <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom we are trying to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>...<br/>
<br/>
This needs to be outlined more clearly and may need to be <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the contract.<br/>
<br/>
So, even though I think the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers would probably be <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing the investments, the more important point is that those original <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ers of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> become the <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="title.htm">title</a> holders of that new Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To answer your question more directly: I would not be 'expanding' my <a href="own.htm">own</a> holdings, but would instead be acting a sort of "growth conduit" for those who do not yet have sufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> The question is, how does selling me a share affect the value</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> of everyone else's share?</span><br/>
<br/>
Where you say "selling me a share" I will rewrite "my <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>".&nbsp;&nbsp;So your question becomes:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> how does my <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> affect the value of everyone else's share?</span><br/>
<br/>
When you <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>, that overpayment is held with the overpayments of many other <a href="user.htm">user</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
After there are sufficient <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s to move forward, those <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s become your <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in more Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es such as a new farm or another factory.<br/>
<br/>
You are not taking any value from anyone else, you are <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing your <a href="own.htm">own</a> growth through the collective purchase of the material means of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion needed to meet your <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ectives.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> Suppose there are a million shares</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by various people, and the farm sells me one share.</span><br/>
<br/>
It is probably confusing to think of this in terms of <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional 'shares' because what I'm talking about it a % of <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership shared among *only that group of <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ers*.<br/>
<br/>
There are no committees or board-members or any such bureaucracy unless that individual group decides they want to subject themselves to such a system of rule.&nbsp;&nbsp;Very large groups may find some need for variations of such self-imposed structure.<br/>
<br/>
Groups of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers using the contract are *fully independent* of each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers will decide they want the oil changed in their tiller every 200 hrs, while another group may decide they will do it every 300 hrs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> Does that mean that there are now 1,000,0001 shares <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed,</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> and everyone else's share has gone down a little in value?</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> Or do they get a dividend?</span><br/>
<br/>
If by 'dividend' you mean "will the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers receive some of the <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as a reward?" then the answer is 'no'.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is treated as an investment from the <a href="user.htm">user</a> who paid it because <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> measures a <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er's lack of <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
----<br/>
<br/>
<small>(*)</small> THE CONTRACT is the <small>(as yet incomplete)</small> legally-binding "Terms of Operation" that <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers can choose to apply to their <a href="own.htm">own</a> Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<small>(**)</small> When there is just 1 <a href="own.htm">own</a>er, <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is easily 'hidden' when the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s himself excessive wages which takes from the pool that would have otherwise been labeled <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This ability diminishes as <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is multiplexed, since the other <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers will then demand such <a href="job.htm">job</a>s be put 'on the market' to lower their <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s.<br/>

I <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> that <a href="land.htm">Land</a> and Capital <small>(<a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership)</small> is the most<br/>
foundational problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="own.htm">Own</a> or be <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ed.<br/>
<br/>
But this does not conflict with my message.<br/>
<br/>
I talk mostly about how <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> should be treated.&nbsp;&nbsp;But notice what I<br/>
say should be done with it: It must be invested in <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership <small>(<a href="land.htm">Land</a> and Capital)</small> for the <a href="user.htm">user</a> who paid it.<br/>
<br/>
The reason this is the 'solution' to our need for <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership<br/>
is that <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is measuring the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er's *lack* or *need for* <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
So you might say:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> = 1/<a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty<br/>
<br/>
As <a href="user own.htm">user own</a>ership in <a href="land.htm">Land</a> and Capital increases, the less <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> he<br/>
will <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> - as he becomes his <a href="own.htm">own</a> supplier <small>[<small>[Without necessarily being<br/>
the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er that operates those Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion]</small>]</small>.<br/>

Wealth here appears to be representing '<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t', not '<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>'.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> doesn't exist unless the Apples are sold.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the<br/>
point-of-sale, if the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er gives more than it <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er<br/>
to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e that <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect, then <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> has been paid.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if you <a href="own.htm">own</a> a plot of ground <small>(<a href="land.htm">Land</a>)</small>, and Apple tree and<br/>
tools <small>(Capital)</small> and are willing to <a href="work.htm">work</a> or to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> someone else<br/>

<br/>
<span class="quot">> If so, who has a claim to what portion? If the problem is indeed <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>, could it not be caused by an imbalance on the other side of the equation?</span><br/>
<br/>
Yes, that is true.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> can be thought of as the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er's lack of<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> only occurs when the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er has insufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the<br/>
<a href="land.htm">Land</a> and Capital needed to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e that thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise he can hire<br/>
another to do the Labor <small>(a <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>)</small> or even do that <a href="work.htm">work</a> himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;He<br/>
will have to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the other <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, but will not <a href="pay.htm">pay</a><br/>

Since corporations are the only ones getting anything done, <small>(where does your ce<a href="real.htm">real</a> come from?)</small>, and since every corporation would go out of business unless <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> were being collected, then what are we to do otherwise?<br/>
<br/>
The corporations have so much power because WE paid them!<br/>
<br/>
If we don't like the power they have, then shouldn't we stop <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing?<br/>
But if we do that, then where will all the things we need come from?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is tempting to pretend "God-dammit, I'll just pull up my britches and do it myself!".&nbsp;&nbsp;But that is only a dream when your britches are from China.<br/>
<br/>
Most individuals can't <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e all of even their basic needs in solitary confinement.&nbsp;&nbsp;We must learn how to organize in a corrected manner to allow specialized <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion while treating the value called '<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>' in a way that avoids handing control to those that <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently organize.<br/>
<br/>
Why are the Chinese so <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive?<br/>
Why is the US no longer <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive?<br/>
<br/>
Many people will say "Well, it's just not <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>able to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers so much in the US when the same labor is 1/10 the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e in China/India."<br/>
<br/>
These things must be said without much thought, since the same person is likely also an opponent of Corporate power which has been brought about by their collecting <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> from us, the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing consumers.<br/>
<br/>
