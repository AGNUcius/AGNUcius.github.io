I <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> it is a matter of distributing, or even auto-distributing <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership over the physical means of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion to the "right" people.<br/>
<br/>
My personal conclusion is that <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty should be <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by those who <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>, and any <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> that Consumers <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <small>(what is usually called <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> should be handled as an investment from them. In that way, <a href="user.htm">User</a>s gain <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom and control in the physical <a href="real.htm">real</a>m similar to the <a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom <a href="rms.htm">RMS</a> has helped <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers syndicate through the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>.<br/>
<br/>
But even if I am wrong about WHO should <a href="own.htm">own</a> <small>(maybe it is the <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers as most suggest)</small>, either decision can be enforced by *us* by <a href="start.htm">start</a>ing a *<a href="new.htm">new</a>* company who's initial <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers choose to apply some kind of "operational contract" that <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>es the constraints are held in place over the life of the corporation.<br/>
<br/>
If that contract 'solves' some of the problems we see in raw capitalism, then we will outperform and eventually overgrow the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent giants.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could there be a way to <a href="start.htm">start</a> looking at <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern commercial companies in a way where the balance of power is radically <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> from the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent hegemony of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers?<br/>
<br/>
What are some disadvantages of creating and presiding over our <a href="own.htm">OWN</a> corporation instead of begging others to "do the right thing"?<br/>
<br/>
Can "the right thing" be phrased in contractual language so it can be enforced through regular <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty rights?<br/>

<span class="quot">"'The <small>(<a href="free.htm">Free</a>)</small> Market for Corporate Control<br/>
<br/>
By Brad Edmonds&nbsp;&nbsp;Posted on 12/12/2007<br/>
<br/>
The Securities Exchange Commission <small>(SEC)</small> was created as a response by forcible government to the perceived excesses of the <a href="free.htm">free</a> market that led <small>(if you believe government reports)</small> to the 1929 <a href="stock.htm">stock</a> market crash that precipitated the Great Depression.<br/>
<br/>
In actuality, loose cr<a href="edit.htm">edit</a> policies, possible only when an entity divorced from the pressures of supply and demand creates a <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y substitute not based in any <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic <a href="real.htm">real</a>ity, were what led to the rampant speculation that led in turn to the 1929 correction in the <a href="stock.htm">stock</a> market. The depression that followed, itself a result of government market interventions such as high minimum wages and <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ionism, convinced the central government to create more rules and bureaucracies to rein in the speculation that itself was a child of government intervention.<br/>
<br/>
What we have now is a cornucopia of SEC regulations having the force of law intended as surrogates for inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a> due diligence. These are accompanied by <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e regulations that in large <a href="part.htm">part</a> are advertised as shareholder <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>hylactics that in practice are nothing more than expensive favors given to local corporations by sympathetic <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e legislatures.<br/>
<br/>
This describes the market for corporate governance. Corporations owe their existence to the fact that, for hundreds of years, mankind has enjoyed technology that allows a single wily entrepreneur to improve the standard of <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>ing of millions of people. A single <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a, such as the automobile, can bring about major changes for all of us. Many such important <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>as are <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult to <a href="real.htm">real</a>ize without the aggregated savings of hundreds or thousands of individuals. Hence the invention of the corporation: a fictional legal entity, a set of relationships governed by contract and <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ute, that <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es possible great accumulations of wealth that can be focused on specific brilliant visions.<br/>
<br/>
Along with these great aggregations of wealth comes the possibility of conflicts of interest. Rationally disinterested inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s, like you and me who hold our little 401k retirement accounts that are invested in dozens of large corporations, are the true <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of the corporations. While we are the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, the great wealth amassed on our behalf is controlled by a few -- perhaps seven to eighteen -- corporate directors and officers. These directors and officers control great wealth, and are entrusted to <a href="employ.htm">employ</a> it to our benefit. As these individuals control the wealth, they face incentives to grant themselves lavish perquisites, and to instantiate defenses against loss of control in order to entrench themselves in their cushy positions. Ross Johnson and the officers of RJR Nabisco, who lost control in a takeover battle memorialized in a book and movie, provide an example: their 20 corporate jets and other emoluments helped <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e RJR Nabisco a stagnant, mediocre performer ripe for takeover by anyone who could raise the <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s and <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e better <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s after taking control.<br/>
<br/>
This market for corporate control, exemplified by mergers, acquisitions, hostile and friendly takeovers, and all manner of complicated transactions -- reverse triangular mergers, <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>utory short-form mergers, cash buyouts, etc. -- designed to skirt otherwise-mandatory shareholder votes and <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>utory obstructions, often is the only incentive for managers to pursue diligently corporate efficiency and <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>ability. Reputation and credibility are often enough to induce managers to perform well. When this is not the case, the threat of losing one's <a href="job.htm">job</a> certainly lights a fire under even the most complacent corporate officer.<br/>
<br/>
And yet, in the <a href="gui.htm">gui</a>se of coming to the <a href="rescue.htm">rescue</a> of hapless shareholders <small>(who, incidentally, rely on the expertise of analysts who buy securities for large institutional inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s such as retirement <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s, mutual <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s, and <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ers)</small>, in gallops the valiant SEC and <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e legislatures to save the day.<br/>
<br/>
The term "poison pill" de<a href="note.htm">note</a>s a variety of takeover defenses, most authorized by <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ute, that <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e corporate takeovers <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult for one who wants to acquire a corporation whose directors and managers decide to resist. Here's how a poison pill <a href="work.htm">work</a>s: Boards of directors create "rights" held by <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of common <a href="stock.htm">stock</a> in a corporation. These rights are similar to <a href="stock.htm">stock</a> options or warrants, granting the holder the opportunity to, for example, buy a number of shares <small>(in accord with the number of shares already <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed)</small> at a discount <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e. Upon a triggering circumstance, such as a certain percentage of <a href="stock.htm">stock</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by an outsider <small>(usually 20%)</small>, the rights are instantiated, and the rights apply only to the shareholders not attempting to take over the corporation.<br/>
<br/>
Michigan and Indiana are examples of <small>(the many)</small> <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>es that have anti-takeover <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>utes in effect. Under such <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>utes, if a single <a href="stock.htm">stock</a>holder crosses a specified threshold of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership <small>(again, usually 20% of the outstanding shares)</small>, that <a href="stock.htm">stock</a>holder loses his voting rights unless a majority of the other shareholders vote to <a href="restor.htm">restor</a>e those rights.<br/>
<br/>
The result: There are fewer corporate takeovers than there were in the 1970s and 1980s, before such <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>utes were <a href="pass.htm">pass</a>ed, and before the poison pill was invented by the inventive corporate defense attorney Martin Lipton. The takeovers that succeed today are "friendly" ones, of which the target corporation's board of directors approves, as opposed to the "hostile" takeovers that characterized the wild and woolly 1980s. In friendly takeovers, please <a href="note.htm">note</a>, the acquirer usually buys out the directors and officers with offers of lucrative "consultant" contracts that keep the ousted officers and directors gainfully <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ed.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>e legislatures approve such laws because the laws are lobbied for by representatives of the corporate directors and officers in the legislatures' jurisdictions. "We mustn't let some outsider come in and fire all our constituents" is the usual lobbyists' battle cry. The result for shareholders, however, is loss of wealth %G—%@ essentially, the possible gains in value of all our little retirement accounts are transferred to the sellout directors and officers.<br/>
<br/>
Before all the anti-takeover <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>utes, hostile acquirers would offer shareholders a premium <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e for their shares %G—%@ usually 25 to 100% above the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent market <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e. In the face of such takeover bids, directors and officers would find some reason to persuade courts that the takeover bids presented some kind of "threat" to the "corporate enterprise" <small>(as though the corporation should be considered an entity a<a href="part.htm">part</a> from the shareholders themselves)</small>. Usual threats included the dire possibility of liquidation <small>(we hear a gasp from the audience)</small> %G—%@ as though you, the shareholder, would be upset to be offered a tidy <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> on the shares you hold, and as though you'd care what happened to the corporation, including its half-dozen senior officers, after you made your <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$20<br/>
"There is nothing government can do that <a href="free.htm">free</a> markets can't do better."<br/>
<br/>
Corporations exist ultimately for the benefit of their <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers. The <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of all the major corporations in the US and the world are you and me. The market value of a share of <a href="stock.htm">stock</a> is the <a href="net.htm">net</a> present value of its future cash flows %G—%@ dividends, plus a gain in the share <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e <a href="real.htm">real</a>ized upon later sale of the <a href="stock.htm">stock</a>. If you, the <a href="stock.htm">stock</a>holder, can <a href="real.htm">real</a>ize a sudden and greater-than-expected gain, you are better off.<br/>
<br/>
The market for corporate control, at its <a href="free.htm">free</a>st, absent government impediments to corporate takeovers, induces managers to continually strive for greater efficiency and <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>ability. Hampering that market entrenches managers and directors at your expense. Government <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es a pursuit of hampering that market.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, in the market for corporate control as in every other regulated industry <a href="imag.htm">imag</a>inable, government creates barriers to the creation of wealth at the behest of the wealthiest and most connected among us, and at the expense of the rest of us. While it is inconsistent with Austrian <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omics and the ethics of <a href="lib.htm">lib</a>erty to begrudge the good fortune of entrepreneurs who become wealthy as a result of improving our <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>es, it is good to resent government intrusions that divide us into <a href="cam.htm">cam</a>ps, with some benefiting at the involuntary expense of others.<br/>
<br/>
This sums up the effect of any forcible government on any <a href="free.htm">free</a> market: those connected with forcible government are benefited while overall human progress is stunted. There is nothing government can do that <a href="free.htm">free</a> markets can't do better.<br/>

<hr/><span class="date">Dec-12-2007:</span> Unsent Letter to Mika<br/>
<span class="quot">> Patrick,</span><br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have found your comments very thought provoking.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way the wiki I have created is opened to all to <a href="edit.htm">edit</a>. All you</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> need if I understand correctly is to apply to the <a href="admin.htm">admin</a> guy <small>(that's me)</small></span><br/>
<span class="quot">> by clicking on the ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riate button and I'll give you access.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp; You've provided a <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful list of links which I'll take a bit of</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> time to explore.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the initial rules of the <a href="game.htm">game</a> - this is interesting, there is a</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e off between <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing it <a href="real.htm">real</a> and as you suggest laws of physics</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> could be the bare minimum but you would need a very easy entry level for</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipating. I would not like people to be put off to easily or be</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> plain bored.</span><br/>
<br/>
Yes, I've thought alot about those things and need to write more of it down.&nbsp;&nbsp;My intention is to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e caring for your body and environment mostly 'automated' and out of the way while still allowing the <a href="user.htm">user</a> to attempt controlling as much of these 'vegetal' requirements as is interesting to them.<br/>
<br/>
But the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a of physical requirements is important to me because I don't see another way of simulating the conditions needed to foster the growth of <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic systems as defined by how the players eventually choose to interact with one another.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a homeless player's body is getting weak because he has not eaten or slept in a few days, what lengths will he go to for a loaf?<br/>
<br/>
We can <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e it easy enough at first by <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ing at least one 'city' in the <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual world is a permaculture paradise.<br/>
<br/>
But I also expect most <a href="user.htm">user</a>s may choose to operate as regular Capitalists with the v<a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty they <a href="own.htm">own</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will help us test the validity of the simulation and to compare other <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion such as whatever the details of Wikitopia that you envision, or my goals with <a href="ecocom.htm">EcoCom</a>ics, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> So I had <a href="imag.htm">imag</a>ined just like the Marxists who <a href="imag.htm">imag</a>ined one</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> would inherit society post Capitalism, the <a href="game.htm">game</a> similarly would inherit</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> the means of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, its good bits and its abberations which</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> gradually the <a href="game.htm">game</a> will have to shape to human needs. And so on for the</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> rest of the society inherited from world capitalism its good bits and</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> its defects.</span><br/>
<br/>
I actually <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> that a server operator should be able to <a href="start.htm">start</a> the <a href="game.htm">game</a> at any level of 'progress'.&nbsp;&nbsp;This would also be <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful to re-create the conditions of a place on earth at some point in time for instance.<br/>
<br/>
But <a href="part.htm">part</a> of what I was talking about with the nail, forge and mine has to do with the programming <a href="work.htm">work</a> involved in <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing the simulation accurate.<br/>
<br/>
We <small>(eventually)</small> will be able to <a href="start.htm">start</a> a <a href="game.htm">game</a> that begins with fully operational factories for the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of everything we already <a href="know.htm">know</a> how to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e in the <a href="real.htm">real</a> world, and <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>es full of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, but I think all <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion during the <a href="game.htm">game</a> must follow a simple 'require' rule that allows copying <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects only when all prerequisites for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion have been met.<br/>
<br/>
You can <small>(eventually)</small> copy a loaf of bread, but you'll need a sunny spot of <a href="land.htm">land</a>, some water, some wheat seed, some <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>, patience and time, some tools to sow, harvest, thresh, grind, mix, knead, bake, cool, cut, butter and eat.<br/>
<br/>
My opinion is that if the <a href="game.htm">game</a> does not enforce some simple requirements of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, a meaningful <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy cannot emerge.<br/>
<br/>
But I also <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> that annoying and boring are not good.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp; It would have two advantages:</span><br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1- show a path between where we are now and where we want to be</span><br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 - it would be more <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>ro level, we would not have to as you mentioned</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> create the basic forge to shape the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects we need - so in theory the</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> learning curve would be less of an uphill one.</span><br/>
<br/>
I think I understand you and <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> with your desire to simplify and streamline the interface.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder, do you have any sketches of what you think the <a href="game.htm">game</a> should look like, and/or how do you see this <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> from S<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>dLife?<br/>
<br/>
If you envision things the same as S<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>dLife, then how will Wikitopia be <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>?<br/>
<br/>
If Wikitopia is <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> from S<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>dLife, then in what ways is it <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> - especially with respect to <a href="user.htm">user</a> <a href="free.htm">free</a>doms and account <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>ing?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll think some more and write some more soon...</span><br/>

<br/>
Subject: <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers control too much when <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is not treated as "Consumer Investment"<br/>
<br/>
People seem fascinated with observing and discussing 'bad' corporations and the politicians that <a href="work.htm">work</a> for them, but why is nobody interested in discovering *WHY* they <a href="work.htm">work</a> against us?<br/>
<br/>
Must every business and all the governments they control be against the very consumers and citizens they claim to serve?<br/>
<br/>
If a few people <a href="land.htm">land</a>ed on an is<a href="land.htm">land</a> would they immediately attack each other?&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems obvious they would try to cooperate, but then when or how does it go wrong?<br/>
<br/>
Does the scale of the situation <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e the former problem disappear?&nbsp;&nbsp;When does a society begin attacking itself <small>(at what number or concentration of people)</small>?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> I just think that perfect world cannot be attained overnight.</span><br/>
<br/>
Neither do I.&nbsp;&nbsp;The way I envision implementing this through normal <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership will be quite slow at first, but will grow exponentially if it is more efficient <small>(<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic)</small> in the way I claim it is.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> So, in order to take baby steps toward a goal, I should focus on one little thing at a time.&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing that I'm focused on right now is getting some good <a href="land.htm">land</a>, and eventually <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing for it in full.</span><br/>
<br/>
Our goals do not conflict; in fact, <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is the only way I <a href="know.htm">know</a> how to implement the <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment I've been <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing on called "The <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public law.htm">General Public Law</a>".<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> Now, in this world, we'll never completely <a href="own.htm">own</a> something, because we have a Govt to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty taxes to, but I can at least get as close as possible.</span><br/>
<br/>
US <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty taxes are at the city and county levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;If there enough intial inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s willing to buy a larger area, we might declare ourselves an independent city and only be required to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> county taxes - and presumably only for the services we ask the county to provide?<br/>
<br/>
Eventually <small>(think long term)</small> if selling organic <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e brings the high wages and high <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s I expect it would, and if we choose to treat those <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s as investments from the consumers who paid them, then WE as a community will increase in size and <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive diversity as the <a href="land.htm">land</a> and capital purchased through those <a href="user.htm">user</a> investments will be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to <a href="install.htm">install</a> <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive permacultured housing across counties, <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>es and nations.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> Once I have the <a href="land.htm">land</a>, I can begin the next phase of my plan, which is to</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> grow crops... who <a href="know.htm">know</a>s if my dreams will ever come true, but I can only</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> keep <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing, and hope!</span><br/>
<br/>
I wish I were better at growing.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are dangerously dependent upon the very corporations who's operations we deride.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> You guys should do something with that acreage</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> you have.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do pinyon trees grow there?&nbsp;&nbsp;You could <a href="start.htm">start</a> a pine nut</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> business... You can take baby steps by undercutting the Chinese farmers</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> and selling them for like $7/lb.</span><br/>
<br/>
Yes, I've looked into those.&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar to you, I will plant some of these slow-to-<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e varieties only after I've moved to where I'd like to <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;Utah is not that place.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp;It wouldn't be a <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> if you put it all in Lilly's college or something!</span><br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between "Consumer <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e" and "<a href="own.htm">Own</a>er <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s".&nbsp;&nbsp;"<a href="own.htm">Own</a>er <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s" include all Wages paid to <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is a measure of value, but is not a reward to be won - rather, <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is a mismeasure of development.&nbsp;&nbsp;A fully prosperous society would have perfect competition and no <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> at all.<br/>
<br/>
A "for <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>" business must keep <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> to be considered successful.&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e to meet <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> <small>(and <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> to hit zero)</small> would mean failure for that corporation even though it should be the goal of society to <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e abundance.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers of Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s early as opportunity loss or as interest on debt.&nbsp;&nbsp;They also '<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>' through any other risks they take trying to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e that round of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion succeed.<br/>
<br/>
Some of these <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s are <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ectively valid, while others are toast buttering such as inflated wages or bonuses to <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers continuing in to <a href="work.htm">Work</a> in unimportant or posh+overpaid positions.<br/>
<br/>
Inflated Wages <small>(think C*O salaries)</small> divert <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s that would have otherwise been labeled <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> if Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership were more distributed to those who <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts - the consumers.<br/>
<br/>
Consumers already <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s <small>(including Wages)</small> AND they are <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing the <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s which the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers <a href="title.htm">title</a> "<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>".&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumers <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> more than <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> when they don't control <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es because they cannot "go around" the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers unless they were to buy some of their <a href="own.htm">own</a> Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es and <a href="start.htm">start</a> a fully separate corporation.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the goal of such a venture would most likely be the same as the business it was meant to out-compete: to keep <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
When a consumer <a href="own.htm">own</a>s the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es required for the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects he <a href="use.htm">use</a>s, he might <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> other <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers to change the inputs into the outputs while he <a href="work.htm">work</a>s at his <a href="own.htm">own</a> specialty, but that Wage would be a <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
Consumers who <a href="own.htm">own</a> Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es can't <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> unless they were to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> it to themselves as an investment toward future <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers separate Wages from <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> for a Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e when they allow all possible <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers to compete for those <a href="job.htm">job</a>s - with the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>al candidate having the highest <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>/wage ratio but usually with a <a href="skill.htm">skill</a> level minimum and a wage maximum.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers are also Consumers.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers needs food, water, shelter, clothing, sanitation, transportation, education, etc. and expects other people to apply their <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s so he can buy lunch after <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ing his labor.<br/>
<br/>
But there are barriers to <a href="trad.htm">Trad</a>e <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think of this as a matter of re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e allocation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans are mostly innocent because of ignorance.<br/>
<br/>
It is a technical 'performance' issue related to the mis-distribution of <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership that results in a very inefficient system with larger <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers clearly <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing against the rest of society only because we misunderstand the meaning of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Typical corporations have incentive to stop <a href="real.htm">real</a> progress and permanent solutions because <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> requires consumers NOT have control of the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
So "The <a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omy" has for-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> corporations in a strange position where they FAIL <small>(by definition)</small> when a consumer can get <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t "At <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>" because <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is nothing more than keeping <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> *REQUIRES* the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect consumer be dependent upon the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, and may be minimized by treating it as an investment from the consumer who paid it.&nbsp;&nbsp;This distributes control and independence <small>(<a href="free.htm">free</a>dom)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> Those are some good questions, and I <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly don't <a href="know.htm">know</a> the answers.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> will just ask another question: What can we do to stop it??</span><br/>
<br/>
I think everyone that has <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipated in "The <a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omy" already <a href="know.htm">know</a>s what is wrong, but has given up on the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a that we could fix it through <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> And since the underlying factor in all of their actions seem to be <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y and <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>, then the solution would just be to stop buying their <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts!</span><br/>
<br/>
Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;And we need alternatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;You are one of the few I talk to that grasps the importance of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing agriculture.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ag is a <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e of almost all that we need, but requires <a href="land.htm">land</a> and water that are being privatized by the bumbling capitalists.<br/>
<br/>
Most sense something is wrong with "The <a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omy".&nbsp;&nbsp;They say we shouldn't buy <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts from 'bad' <small>(usually coincidental with 'big')</small> corporations because they are for some reason not on our side.<br/>
<br/>
Smaller companies seem less 'bad', but are <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>amentally the same if they seek to keep <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> by denying that <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence is a consumer's investment.<br/>
<br/>
But must all business <small>(and therefore in the end, Govt)</small> always be against us?&nbsp;&nbsp;How do so many well intentioned communities tend to fail as they grow in size?<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between the <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e a consumer <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s for an <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect<small>(ive)</small> and the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es paid for it's <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
But why does a consumer ever <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> more that <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>?&nbsp;&nbsp;An <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect consumer <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> when he does not have <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of those <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ectives.<br/>
<br/>
We <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> $9.00/lb for pine nuts from China because the Govt removed millions of Pinyon trees from the Western United <a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>es under the <a href="gui.htm">gui</a>se of improving cattle grazing.&nbsp;&nbsp;The De<a href="part.htm">part</a>ment of Agriculture 2007 Farm Bill is yet another handout to big agri-business 'farmers' that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s these <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers to NOT grow things such as wheat to keep <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>es above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s since we have <small>[insanely]</small> crowned <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as the very measure of success!<br/>
<br/>
The more dependent a society is upon such corporations, the more potential for those corporations to <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> through higher <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>es and lower wages.<br/>
<br/>
By this we see that <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is inversely related to <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership Distribution and Vendor Competition.&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition is perfected as the number of vendors is maximized, because each Consumer *becomes* his <a href="own.htm">own</a> vendor as he gains <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the <a href="land.htm">land</a>, <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>dings, water rights, fungi/flora/fauna and tools needed for the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion that must occur.<br/>
<br/>
If a consumer could somehow gain <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es needed for his daily bread, such as the wheat fields, tractors, grainaries, grinders and ovens, then a strange ~ almost magical thing happens:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e approaches <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> and <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> approaches zero.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the perfect<small>(*)</small> case:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e == <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> and <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> == 0<br/>
<br/>
When <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty is finally in the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a> hands, democracy will be direct because <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers rule their <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty through votes amongst themselves weighted by their % of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in that <a href="part.htm">part</a>icular Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> Or, in</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> this case, stop watching their <a href="new.htm">new</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can go on the internet to get any</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> of our <a href="new.htm">new</a>s anyway, from anywhere we want.&nbsp;&nbsp;So the <a href="key.htm">key</a> to ensuring this to</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> be still available for years to come is to stop the Govt from trying to</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> regulate the internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul's the only guy out there who addresses this</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> issue.</span><br/>
<br/>
When you <a href="use.htm">use</a> the word "Govt", you should replace it in your mind with "Corp" because it is the <a href="own.htm">OWN</a>ERS of the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent internet infrastructure such as AT&amp;T etc. that want more regulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;And they want more regulation because <a href="art.htm">Art</a>ificial Scarcity increases the potential for <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
This is why we must BUY some <a href="land.htm">land</a> and tools and become the <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="own.htm">OWN</a>ERS that <a href="start.htm">start</a> businesses, including ISP and hosting providers, that treat <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as an investment from the consumer who paid it - so the corporation would grow through the <a href="user.htm">user</a> investment called <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> that is usually pocketed by the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers as a prize <small>(a prize that also happens to incent the anti-social behaviour we have already discussed)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> If nobody watches their <a href="new.htm">new</a>s, then the corporations that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for the</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> advertising will go where people are watching, and that puts <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y in the</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> pocket of the honest <a href="new.htm">new</a>s corporations that have all the viewers.&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> in my vision of capitalism, we should reward those that put forth a</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> quality <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, and that all <a href="start.htm">start</a>s with the consumer being more</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> discerning on where they want to spend their earnings.</span><br/>
<br/>
I <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> with this, and as I said, many people understand at this 'level' of complexity.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>iculty is in <a href="start.htm">start</a>ing an extended discussion about the details of WHY.<br/>
<br/>
Most people I try to engage in the intricacies of why "The <a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omy" fails us find it far too boring - <a href="part.htm">part</a>ially I think because they have unconsciously given up on the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a we could ever be in direct control.<br/>

<hr/><span class="date">Dec-03-2007:</span> E<a href="mail.htm">mail</a> to Mika at <a class="ext" href="http://Mikatopia.BlogSpot.com">Mikatopia.BlogSpot.com</a><br/>
<span class="quot">> Hello Patrick,</span><br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I am deligthed by your e<a href="mail.htm">mail</a> and must apologise for answering it</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> with a 2 weeks delay. I had almost lost hope someone would provide</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> feed<a href="back.htm">back</a> and had stopped <a href="moni.htm">moni</a>toring the account daily.</span><br/>
<br/>
You see I'm a slow responder myself ;-)</small><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp; You see, I put together these sites a while ago in the hope someone like</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> you would find the concepts interesting or were indeed like you already</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> thinking about these concepts.</span><br/>
<br/>
I guess wiki spam made you disallow <small>(or maybe you never allowed)</small> <a href="user.htm">user</a>-created wiki accounts?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have copied an old friend, Ric<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> Greeman <small>(you can google him or</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> check <a class="ext" href="http://www.nybooks.com/nyrb/authors/13178">http://www.nybooks.com/nyrb/authors/13178</a> )</small> who I am sure will be</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> very keen to join in the discussion. Ric<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> has been thinking and</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> writting about this concept for many years, long before I began to</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> <a href="art.htm">art</a>iculate my <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>as on the topic.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp; What I had envisaged would have been <a href="collab.htm">collab</a>orating on a wiki to</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> elaborate rules of a <a href="new.htm">new</a> society which in turn would provide a developer</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> such as yourself the rules for turning this into a <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual world. Now I</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> have been in the IT industry for a long time and I do <a href="real.htm">real</a>ise this is</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> far easier said than done.</span><br/>
<br/>
We'll <a href="collab.htm">collab</a>orate in the wiki and later, also in the <a href="game.htm">game</a> :^)</small><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp; Another approach might be to "highjack" or rather <a href="use.htm">use</a> s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>d life in its</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> present form</span><br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> and set up an is<a href="land.htm">land</a> banishing commerce and trialling</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> industries geared to human needs could flourish - but it sounds a bit</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> far fetched no ?&nbsp;&nbsp;and how would you play the <a href="game.htm">game</a> ?</span><br/>
<br/>
Here are some of my <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>as along those lines...<br/>
<br/>
There will always be <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s for hosting, and they will only increase with the number of <a href="user.htm">user</a>s if we succeed in drawing attention, which is <a href="part.htm">part</a> of what I assume we are trying to do.<br/>
<br/>
Some <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s are periodic, such as a hosting service's monthly or yearly charge while other <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s depend upon usage, such the hosting service's bandwidth limits, CPU, RAM, <a href="hard.htm">Hard</a> Drive, electricity.&nbsp;&nbsp;The various 'loads' a <a href="user.htm">user</a> puts on the <a href="game.htm">game</a> server should weight his <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e to incent thrifty <a href="user.htm">user</a>s and <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e heavy <a href="user.htm">user</a>s <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for excluding others.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s we'll face <small>(including our labor)</small>:<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Define the purposes and goals of the <a href="game.htm">game</a> at a high level.<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Organize and orthoganalize meaningful player constraints.<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Write some pseudo-code to discuss flow and logic.<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Remix some <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software to begin an implementation.<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Find a hosting provider; setup and maintain <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ments.<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> <a href="install.htm">Install</a> the software and keep the server running.<br/>
<br/>
Some <a href="user.htm">user</a>s, especially <a href="new.htm">new</a>bies impact these <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s very little because they have such a small " footprint".<br/>
<br/>
As <a href="user.htm">user</a>s advance, some would be willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s that their "<a href="own.htm">own</a>ing" and "using" in the <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual world put on the server.<br/>
<br/>
Getting this all figured out and getting the <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y collected is quite a mess, so many <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software <a href="game.htm">game</a> servers offer the connection for '<a href="free.htm">free</a>' - in that there is no connection fee.<br/>
<br/>
That is somewhat philanthropic on the surface, but there is a control issue because these hosting <a href="admin.htm">admin</a>istrators <small>(probably the same programmers that are <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing on this version of the <a href="game.htm">game</a>)</small> have arbitrary dictatorial control over any number of <a href="user.htm">user</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would call this a "common" problem in these communities, and is central to what I see as the problem with most communities in the physical world as well.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br/>
<br/>
One <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a I've had about commerce is to just "let it emerge" <small>(in all it's various forms)</small> in whatever community of <a href="user.htm">user</a>s that finally play the <a href="game.htm">game</a>.<br/>
<br/>
That emergence will require the player's <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual "body" face <a href="real.htm">real</a> and re<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ing needs and their 'solutions' including: sleep<small>(<a href="land.htm">land</a>, house)</small>, drink<small>(water)</small>, eat<small>(food/medicine)</small>, clean<small>(<a href="soap.htm">soap</a>, sanitation, sewer)</small>, cover<small>(cloth)</small>, heat<small>(fuel)</small>, etc.<br/>
<br/>
For the <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e sense, all <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion must occur somewhere in the <a href="game.htm">game</a> and be based on "prerequisites" being met.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the right plants, animals and tools are not available, then those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts will not be available.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want nails, you will need a forge and a smeltering pot and iron ore and tools to dig for the ore <small>(unless you are lucky enough to find some near the surface)</small>, etc.<br/>
<br/>
This will <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e the <a href="game.htm">game</a> very bleak and maybe even boring at first, but I think this might actually good, because it will keep the complexity low for a period of time - hopefully long enough for us to learn what is wrong with the <a href="real.htm">real</a>-world <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy.<br/>
<br/>
There should be no <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial restrictions such as a 'force-fields' when a person attempts to cross a border or take an <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect that is not his <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty is very important, but we don't want to solve anything with *magic* or we won't see what how the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s will organize to solve it for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Some <a href="user.htm">user</a>s may choose to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e some things "against the law" for some <a href="land.htm">land</a> or capital that they <a href="own.htm">own</a>, but such laws are only enforceable within their borders, and only in the same ways they can be enforced in <a href="real.htm">real</a> life.<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, the laws of *physics* should be the only constraints, and should be fully enforced.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp; So anyway, my first <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ective was to spark discussion with interested</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> developers so looks like we are on the right track !</span><br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ric<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> by CC - comment away !</span><br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp; All the very best !</span><br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mika</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<br/>
Maybe the wiki would be the best place to <a href="start.htm">start</a>?<br/>
<br/>
