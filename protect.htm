From Wikipedia, the <a href="free.htm">free</a> encyclopedia.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="protect.htm">Protect</a>ionism is the <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic policy of <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ing a nation's manufacturing base from the effects of foreign competition by means of very high tariffs on imported goods, restrictive quotas, or other means of reducing importation. This contrasts with the <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el, in which foreign <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts are exempted from tariffs, allowing foreign <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers to access a domestic market without the tax burden in<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ed by domestic manufacturers.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="protect.htm">Protect</a>ionism has frequently been associated with mercantilism, the belief that it is beneficial to maintain a positive <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e balance; and import substitution.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="protect.htm">Protect</a>ionism comes in two variants, depending on whether the tariff is intended to be collected <small>(<a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ionism)</small> or not <small>(<a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ionism)</small>.<br/>

<a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>ern <a href="protect.htm">Protect</a>ionism<br/>
<br/>
Most <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern views of <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ionism call for placing tariffs at such a high level as to compel the consumer to buy the domestic <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t. With this version of <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ionism, no tariff revenue is generated for the government, and the consumer is burdened both with high <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es on the domestic <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t and no income or other domestic tax relief.<br/>
<br/>
In the <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e <a href="arena.htm">arena</a> many other initiatives besides tariffs have been dubbed <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ionism. For example some commentators, such as Jagadish Bagwatti, see developed countries' efforts in imposing their <a href="own.htm">own</a> labor or environmental standards as <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ionism. Also, the imposition of restrictive certification procedures on imports are seen in this light.<br/>
<br/>
Recent examples of <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ionism are typically motivated by the desire to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> the <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>elihoods of politically important domestic industries, such as farmers in the United <a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>es and European Union, who in the absence of tariffs might be unable to compete with both lower-<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> and untaxed foreign <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers. Whereas formerly it was blue-collar <a href="job.htm">job</a>s being lost to foreign competition, in recent years there has been a renewed discussion of <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ionism due to offshore out<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>ing and the loss of white-collar <a href="job.htm">job</a>s. Most <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists view this form of <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ionism as a disguised transfer <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment from consumers <small>(who <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> higher <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es for food or other <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ed goods)</small> to local high-<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers.<br/>

<a href="trad.htm">Trad</a>itional <a href="protect.htm">Protect</a>ionism<br/>
<br/>
In its hi<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>ic sense, <a href="protect.htm">Protect</a>ionism is the <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic policy of relying on revenue tariffs for government <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing in order to reduce or eliminate taxation on domestic industries and labor <small>(e.g., corporate and personal income taxes.)</small> In <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ionist theory, emphasis is placed on reducing taxation on domestic labor and savings at a <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of higher tariffs on foreign <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts. This contrasts from the <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el, in which first emphasis is placed on exempting foreign <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts from taxation, with the lost revenue to be compensated domestically.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="trad.htm">Trad</a>itional <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ionism sees revenue tariffs as a <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e of government <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing, much like a sales tax, that can be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to reduce other domestic forms of taxes. The goal of <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ionism is to maximize tax revenue from the purchase of foreign <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts with the goal of being able to reduce or eliminate other forms of domestic taxation <small>(income taxes, sales taxes, etc.)</small> as a result. <small>(Tariffs were the predominant <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e of tax revenue in the United <a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>es from its founding through World War II, allowing the country to operate through most of that period without income and sales taxes.)</small> <a href="trad.htm">Trad</a>itional <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ionism remains highly dependent on large a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a>s of imports and for tariffs to be kept at reasonable rates to ensure maximum government revenue.<br/>
<br/>
Famous early <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ionists in the United <a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>es included Alexander Hamilton <small>(who set the country's financing on the tariff)</small>, Abraham Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt.<br/>
<br/>
One of the leading champions of <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ionism in the United <a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>es today is Pat Buchanan. As he wrote in his 2004 book "Where the Right Went Wrong", "Tariffs raise the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es of goods. True. But all taxes--tariffs, income taxes, sales taxes, <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty taxes--are factored into the final <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e of the goods we buy. When a nation puts a tariff on foreign goods coming into the country, it is able to cut taxes on goods <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed inside the country. This is the way to give U.S. manufacturers and <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers a 'home-field advantage.'"</span><br/>
<br/>
<a href="trad.htm">Trad</a>itional <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ionists fault the <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el as being reverse <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ionism in disguise, that of using tax policy to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> foreign manufacturers from domestic competition. By ruling out revenue tariffs on foreign <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts, government must fully rely on domestic taxation to provide its revenue, which falls heavily dis<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ortionately on domestic manufacturing. Quote Paul Craig Roberts: "<small>[Foreign discrimination of US <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts]</small> is reinforced by the US tax system, which imposes no appreciable tax burden on foreign goods and services sold in the US but imposes a heavy tax burden on US <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers of goods and services regardless of whether they are sold within the US or exported to other countries."*<small>[1]</small><br/>
<br/>
While <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ionists <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>er from <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ionists in that they are very much pro-import <small>(based on their belief that a country should rely on imports as much as possible to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the taxes)</small>, they nonetheless dis<a href="agree.htm">agree</a> with <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ers in that they believe the primary focus should be on exempting domestic manufacturing, rather than foreign, from the various forms of taxation.<br/>

<a href="curr.htm">Curr</a>ent World Trends<br/>
<br/>
It is the <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ed policy of most First World countries to eliminate <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ionism through <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e policies enforced by international treaties and organizations such as the World <a href="trad.htm">Trad</a>e Organization. Despite this, many of these countries still place <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ive and/or revenue tariffs on foreign <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> some favored or politically influential industries, or to reduce the taxation demands on their internal domestic manufacturing, <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing their <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts more competitive. The elimination of these tariffs remains a contentious political and diplomatic issue. China and Japan have been accused of <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ionist policies that peg their <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>encies to the dollar and, thus, set <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es of their exports lower than they would be if the market determined the relative <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es of each <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency.<br/>

<br/>
<a href="protect.htm">Protect</a>ionist quotas can cause foreign <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers to become more <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>able, mitigating their desired effect. This happens because quotas <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificially restrict supply, so it is unable to meet demand; as a result the foreign <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>er can command a premium <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e for its <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts. These increased <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s are <a href="know.htm">know</a>n as quota <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
For example, in the United <a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>es <small>(1981-1994)</small>, Japanese automobile companies were held to voluntary export quotas. These quotas limited the supply of Japanese automobiles desired by consumers in the United <a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>es <small>(1.68 million, raised to 1.85 million in 1984, and raised again to 2.30 million in 1985)</small>, increasing the <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> margin on each automobile more than enough <small>(14% or about $1200 in 1983 dollars, about $2300 in 2005 dollars)</small> to cover the reduction in the number of automobiles that they sold, leading to greater overall <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s for Japanese automobile manufacturers in the United <a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>es export market.dd<br/>
