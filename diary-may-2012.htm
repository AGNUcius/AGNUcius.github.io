Yes, in fact the customers <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> *all* the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, and yet have no control of how those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts are made because they lack the <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership that would give them <a href="real.htm">real</a> voting power.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine groups of customers organize to purchase and <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> the factories and farms for which they need the outputs.<br/>
<br/>
Each person would invest just enough <small>(either Capital or Labor)</small> to cover the predicted <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion for the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t they each intend to <a href="use.htm">use</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Each of these <small>[inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>/<a href="own.htm">own</a>er/customer/<a href="work.htm">work</a>er]</small>s would still need to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> their % of the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s as usual, but since they would accept the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t itself as the return for that risk, there would be sale, and so <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> would not exist at all.<br/>

1.)</small> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t is the Inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>'s Return.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means Consumers will micro-invest by pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing for results, become <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers of that business and receive the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t itself as a side-effect of that <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er's Investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means late-coming Consumers will overpay for <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t as usual, but we will treat <small>(at least some % of)</small> that value as though they had invested as described in #1.<br/>
<br/>
3.)</small> Investments are commitments of Future Labor and Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means we will issue a deposit-based, *<a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ing* <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency <a href="back.htm">back</a>ed by both the <a href="land.htm">land</a> and tools and other inputs, plus the <a href="work.htm">work</a> needed to transform those assets into a <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These adjustments allow us to move away from excessive token-<a href="pass.htm">pass</a>ing and toward <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tivity that can safely reach stasis - eliminating the perceived need for infinite growth.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
