<span class="quot">"'<br/>
1. It should be easy for everyone involved to keep track of who's using the asset when.<br/>
This is kind of a no-brainer. Without this, you have utter chaos. <a href="part.htm">Part</a>ners should be made aware when someone reserves the asset, and there should be some centralized mechanism for <a href="part.htm">part</a>ners to see when the asset is reserved and when it's available next.<br/>
<br/>
2. The system should prevent <a href="part.htm">part</a>ners from scheduling over each other.<br/>
Another no-brainer. It's not <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly a "reservation" if it doesn't prevent others from claiming the same time slot. Again, without this you have chaos.<br/>
<br/>
3. The system should prevent <a href="part.htm">part</a>ners from scheduling more than their share of time in advance.<br/>
Whatever system is in place should ensure that each <a href="part.htm">part</a>ner is not scheduling more usage than they're en<a href="title.htm">title</a>d to, based on their percentage of equity in the asset. Without this, an individual <a href="part.htm">part</a>ner could easily monopolize the shared asset at the expense of the other <a href="part.htm">part</a>ners.<br/>
<br/>
4. The system should allow for unlimited last minute usage if the asset is available.<br/>
In the interest of <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing full <a href="use.htm">use</a> of the asset, it wouldn't <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e much sense to have it sit idle if someone is ready to jump on it at the last minute.<br/>
<br/>
5. The system should have a fair and consistent answer to the central question - "What happens if we all want to <a href="use.htm">use</a> it at the same time?"<br/>
Unless you've <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>d to a <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ic schedule in advance <small>(which fails miserably at #6)</small>, there will definitely be occasions when more than one <a href="part.htm">part</a>ner wants to reserve the same time slot. The system should have a better answer than whoever gets there first wins.<br/>
<br/>
6. Bonus: The system should provide an experience that is as close as possible to sole <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
This is a bonus requirement because an asset-sharing <a href="part.htm">part</a>nership can be successful without it, but it can <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e a world of <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence in how much frustration comes along with the benefits of shared <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership. In an <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>al world, you <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for a <a href="fract.htm">fract</a>ion of an asset and you <a href="use.htm">use</a> it whenever you want or need to. You shouldn't have to plan your life around when you're going to <a href="use.htm">use</a> your asset. It should feel like you're the only <a href="own.htm">own</a>er, except when it comes time to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the bills.<br/>
<br/>
Scheduling Approaches<br/>
<br/>
So, with these requirements in mind let's take a look at some common scheduling approaches. The options generally fall into two categories - <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ic scheduling, or flexible scheduling.<br/>
<br/>
With <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ic scheduling, the <a href="part.htm">part</a>ners <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> in advance to a set schedule that never changes. It might be that <a href="part.htm">part</a>ners alternate weeks, or one <a href="part.htm">part</a>ner gets weekdays and the other gets weekends. There are infinite variations, but the results are the same. You end up scheduling your life around your asset. For something like a vacation home, this approach might be suitable. You generally don't take vacations whenever the mood strikes you so planning around your <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ic block of time isn't that <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult. For something like a car however, this is much less <a href="real.htm">real</a>istic and it <a href="start.htm">start</a>s to feel like your car <a href="own.htm">own</a>s you and not the other way around.<br/>
<br/>
With flexible scheduling, <a href="part.htm">part</a>ners are able to reserve available time without having to <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> to a fixed schedule in advance. Generally, flexible scheduling solutions provide an experience that is much closer to sole <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership. The main draw<a href="back.htm">back</a> to flexible scheduling is that it's more complicated than <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ic scheduling, and if it's not done right it can lead to friction between <a href="part.htm">part</a>ners, and potentially a messy and <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>ly dissolution of the <a href="part.htm">part</a>nership.<br/>
<br/>
Flexible Scheduling Options<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of options available to implement a flexible scheduling system, some better than others. Here are a few of the more common approaches:<br/>
<br/>
"<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ing it out"<br/>
This approach tends to be common in <a href="part.htm">part</a>nerships that are <a href="start.htm">start</a>ed between friends, and typically means that when you want to <a href="use.htm">use</a> your asset you call the other <a href="part.htm">part</a>ners and let them <a href="know.htm">know</a>. If there are only two of you in your <a href="part.htm">part</a>nership and you're close friends or family, this may <a href="work.htm">work</a> out. However, this approach has the highest probability of failure and of ruining your friendship. The problem arises when another <a href="part.htm">part</a>ner says, "me too." Now what? Without a fair and consistent process for <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing decisions in these cases it comes down to whoever is the most persuasive or yells the loudest - not the shared <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership experience you were hoping for. This approach fails to meet any of the requirements from the above list, and should <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly be avoided.<br/>
<br/>
Google Calendar<br/>
The next step up from "<a href="work.htm">work</a>ing it out" is to <a href="use.htm">use</a> a shared Google Calendar. While this is a step in the right direction, and at least provides a way for <a href="part.htm">part</a>ners to keep track of who is using the asset when <small>(#1)</small>, it doesn't do anything to prevent <a href="part.htm">part</a>ners from scheduling over each other <small>(#2)</small>, or more than their share of time <small>(#3)</small>. It also leaves it up to the <a href="part.htm">part</a>ners to decide what happens if more than one <a href="part.htm">part</a>ner wants to reserve the same time slot <small>(#5)</small>. Granted Google Calendar is <a href="free.htm">free</a>, but it's not that much better than just "<a href="work.htm">work</a>ing it out".<br/>
<br/>
Simplistic reservation systems<br/>
There are quite a few options available when it comes to online reservation systems that are designed to simply block time for some shared re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e. All of them provide the basics like a shared calendar <small>(#1)</small> and the blocking of time for reservations <small>(#2)</small>. Some of the better solutions will even provide quotas for each <a href="user.htm">user</a> to ensure that an individual doesn't schedule more than their share of usage in a given time period <small>(#3)</small>. However, because these systems are general purpose scheduling systems they fall short when it comes to dealing with the specifics of managing a shared asset, like distinguishing between reservations made in advance and last minute reservations <small>(#4)</small>. Finally, their approach to dealing with cases when more than one <a href="part.htm">part</a>ner wants to reserve the same time slot is first-come, first-served. While this does provide consistent results, it's far from fair. Should a <a href="part.htm">part</a>ner be able to reserve a time slot when they've already <a href="use.htm">use</a>d the asset more than anyone else simply because they woke up earlier and made their reservation first?<br/>
<br/>
Basic shared <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership management systems<br/>
Now we're getting closer to a <a href="work.htm">work</a>able solution. There are just a handful of applications that are targeted specifically at managing a jointly <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed asset. All of them provide reservation systems and additional features like management of finances and <a href="collab.htm">collab</a>oration features. Some are specific to a certain type of asset, like a boat or airplane, while others are customizable to <a href="work.htm">work</a> with any type of asset. Some provide just the management tools, while others go further to help potential shared <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers find <a href="part.htm">part</a>ners and set up their <a href="part.htm">part</a>nership. When it comes to reservations, these systems have an answer for each of the requirements. They all provide the basics <small>(#1-3)</small>, and most allow for unlimited last minute usage <small>(#4)</small>. They also have a decent answer for dealing with cases when more than one <a href="part.htm">part</a>ner wants to reserve the same time slot <small>(#5)</small>. One common solution for this requirement is wait listing. With wait listing, the first <a href="part.htm">part</a>ner to reserve a time slot is granted the reservation, but the system still collects additional reservations for that time slot and creates a waiting list. In the event that the first <a href="part.htm">part</a>ner cancels their reservation, the next <a href="part.htm">part</a>ner on the waiting list gets the time slot. This is a step in the right direction, but it's <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly just first-come, first-served with a twist that only <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es a <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence when a <a href="part.htm">part</a>ner cancels a reservation. Another common solution is to offer <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>es or purchasing of a time slot. With this approach, the first <a href="part.htm">part</a>ner to request a time slot is still granted the reservation, but other <a href="part.htm">part</a>ners can now offer to <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e another reservation for the one in question, or can offer to purchase the time slot with either cash or <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual "cr<a href="edit.htm">edit</a>s". The draw<a href="back.htm">back</a> with this approach is that it puts the holder of the first reservation in the position of having to directly grant or deny another <a href="part.htm">part</a>ner's request, which can result in friction and resentment between <a href="part.htm">part</a>ners.<br/>
<br/>
Sophisticated shared <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership management systems<br/>
Here's where the list of options gets very short. A sophisticated system has the right answers for all of the requirements, and provides a scheduling experience that is as close as you can get to sole <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership without actually <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing for it <small>(#6)</small>. The <a href="key.htm">key</a> to doing this is how the system handles requests for the same time slot <small>(#5)</small>. A sophisticated reservation system gets away from first-come, first-served entirely and instead <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es intelligent decisions to eliminate scheduling conflicts before they can happen. This is done by separating the reservation process into two steps. The first step is figuring out how many <a href="part.htm">part</a>ners want to <a href="use.htm">use</a> a given time slot - essentially collecting demand. This step is triggered when a <a href="part.htm">part</a>ner requests the first reservation for a given time slot. Instead of granting the reservation immediately, it is held in a pending <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e for a short time while the system notifies the other <a href="part.htm">part</a>ners of the pending reservation. Other <a href="part.htm">part</a>ners who want to reserve that time slot can do so while the reservation is still pending, which triggers the next step in the process. In this step, the system <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es an intelligent decision about who should get the time slot in question by analyzing each <a href="part.htm">part</a>ner's past and future scheduled usage. The time slot is then given to the <a href="part.htm">part</a>ner who has <a href="use.htm">use</a>d <small>(or will <a href="use.htm">use</a>)</small> the asset the least - the fairest possible outcome. Some systems will even apply a weighting factor to more recent usage to try to spread time more evenly among <a href="part.htm">part</a>ners. This two-step reservation process results in the least friction possible between <a href="part.htm">part</a>ners because it is the system that <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es the reservation decision instead of an individual <a href="part.htm">part</a>ner. With this strategy, <a href="part.htm">part</a>ners can even go as far as giving up on scheduling reservations in advance and just reserve their asset whenever they feel the urge, relying on the system to ensure fairness. This is as close as it gets to <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the asset yourself.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you're considering shared <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, or are already sharing something, <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e sure you have the right tools in place because they can have a significant impact on your shared <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership experience. Resist the urge to go with a <a href="free.htm">free</a> or cheap option and seriously consider going with a purpose <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>t solution. You can expect to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> a <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>est monthly fee for these services, but it's well worth it to ensure that you get the best shared <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership experience possible.<br/>

In other words, why do Consumers <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> more for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts than the <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e them <small>(where Wages are also a <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>)</small>?<br/>
<br/>
If you and your neighbors <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ed a small dairy, you would need to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s, including Wages.<br/>
<br/>
But for any milk you <a href="use.htm">use</a> directly, there is no <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> because there was no sale...<br/>
<br/>
Does that mean <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> arises from the Consumer's lack of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion?<br/>
<a href="edit.htm">Edit</a><br/>
<br/>
I am not asking whether <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is a 'fair' or 'moral'. I am thinking in a much more mechanical and blameless way about what causes this <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e and <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
I'm just noticing that when the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of a Milk Cow drinks some of that milk - even if he hired someone else to milk the cow - then, even though he had to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all of the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, he simply *cannot* <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> because he did not buy the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t. <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is appa<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ly *undefined* in this case.<br/>
<br/>
This seems to show that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is caused by the consumer's lack of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
And so eliminating <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> <small>(whether that is a good <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a or not)</small> can be achieved by consumers choosing to invest in the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion for that which they can <a href="use.htm">use</a> directly.<br/>
<br/>
I'm somewhat surprised by this discovery, as I was under the impression that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> was the result of <a href="work.htm">work</a>er efforts...<br/>

I do not <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ose we try selling anything at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Please slow-down and listen to what I am saying.<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small><br/>
When the consumers are the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of the<br/>
Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion, then they *already* <a href="own.htm">own</a><br/>
the outputs of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion even before<br/>
it is <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed.<br/>
<br/>
They do not *buy* the outputs from anyone<br/>
because they <a href="own.htm">own</a> them already!<br/>
<br/>
Since there is no transaction taking place<br/>
after <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, the consumers that have<br/>
sufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion<br/>
receive the outputs at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> as a side-effect<br/>
of their <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Means of those outputs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small><br/>
When the consumer does not yet have sufficient<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion, then<br/>
he must buy the outputs from someone who<br/>
has a surplus.<br/>
<br/>
In that case, I say we *should* charge <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e<br/>
above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> against those non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, for that<br/>
is how we can collect the extra <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s needed<br/>
to grow the collective.<br/>
<br/>
The only <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence I <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ose is that we treat<br/>
that overpayment as though it were an investment<br/>
from the very consumer who paid it - so that he<br/>
also gains <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership in his <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="part.htm">part</a> of<br/>
the collective.<br/>
<br/>
His <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership he paid for <small>(when he paid <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e<br/>
above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>)</small> will <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> him from needing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a><br/>
<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> in the future, for when he has sufficient<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion, he does<br/>
not buy the outputs of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, but <a href="own.htm">own</a>s<br/>
them already.<br/>

<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is not a problem in itself.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is our mistreatment of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Treating <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as a reward for the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, even if we try to be 'nice' about it,<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> We need to create value-based organizations, meaning that value can be</span><br/>

<br/>
Yes, inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s shall receive <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t instead of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.<br/>
This means every inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s must also be a consumer.<br/>
<br/>
And those who arrive late must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for that which<br/>
they gain.&nbsp;&nbsp;They must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> to cover the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, and they must also <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> because<br/>
of their lack of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
It would be against our collective best-interests<br/>
to treat <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as a reward for the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
We must instead treat that overpayment as though<br/>
that consumer had just invested for their future<br/>
so they also gain the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership needed to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a><br/>

When I am unsure how to reason about how a <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the 'corrected'<br/>
system might function, I resort to the "stranded is<a href="land.htm">land</a>er" approach<br/>
and then incrementally scale-up from there.<br/>
<br/>
For example, If a person were stranded and alone on an is<a href="land.htm">land</a>, what<br/>
could he possibly 'invest' in, and what would that even mean?<br/>
<br/>
Let's say the only "manufacturing plants" available to him are some<br/>
coconut trees, which are luckily already <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing for him, but he<br/>
wants to more fully <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e his future...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So first of all we need to determine just *what* he could possibly <a href="use.htm">use</a><br/>
to invest.<br/>
<br/>
Well, it seems to me there are 2 <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>amentally <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> types of<br/>
investments which he can 'commit':<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> The <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>e to labor in the future toward accomplishing some goal.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> The 'Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es' that must be dedicated to this goal <small>(such<br/>
as some square-feet of <a href="land.htm">land</a>, some coconuts which he will plant instead<br/>
of eating directly, some fresh water, etc.)</small><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
bleh...&nbsp;&nbsp;sorry if this is too boring - I'm trying to answer the<br/>
question of "how long must we wait before some investment <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s-out?".<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So my answer is: The <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>out time and quantity and quality for any<br/>
investment should, <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>ally, be bound directly to the *type* of thing<br/>
it is because we should be organizing <a href="user.htm">user</a>s to invest into <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion<br/>
for the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>off of <a href="use.htm">Use</a>-Value - in that they can <a href="use.htm">use</a> the *Outputs*<br/>
instead of relying upon <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s who intend to collect<br/>
<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> <small>(<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
This <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es the system less complex and therefore much easier to<br/>
predict, but also 'solves' the conflict between Customer and Vendor<br/>
relations because the Customer *IS* the Vendor.<br/>
<br/>
This is sufficient for the '<a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ic' case where the number of<br/>
inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>/consumers and the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> they invested is exactly the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a><br/>
needed for them to receive the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t they predicted they<br/>
would want or need.<br/>
<br/>
To solve the 'dynamic' case where there is surplus <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t, we must<br/>
have a legally binding Social Contract that says "All <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of<br/>
Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es can keep all the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t they <a href="own.htm">own</a> as a result of<br/>
their <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es, but if that <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t is instead<br/>
sold to those outside of the coalition, then we should:<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> Charge <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> <small>(<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>)</small> for as much as the market will bear.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> Treat any <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> collected as an investment from the consumer who<br/>
paid it toward even more Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es - so that every <a href="user.htm">user</a> becomes<br/>
a <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>er in <a href="collab.htm">collab</a>orative <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This will also finally allow us to break our addiction to Scarcity,<br/>
since treating <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as a reward for the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers has been a<br/>
Positive-Feed<a href="back.htm">back</a> loop that incents the creation of <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial<br/>
scarcity in the drive to perpetuate the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e and<br/>

Yes, we must be more holistic and inclusive, but in a tactical and even 'defensive' manner similar to how the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>s a community from outside predation...<br/>
<br/>
With that in mind, let me present some of my findings of a surprisingly simple Organizational Form that has always been available but lying dormant and unused - maybe because the <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional ways of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion have until recently been sufficient and had not caused nearly the trouble we see now.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is a rough draft, but I need to send it now, as I have delayed too long already...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
----<br/>
<br/>
Capitalism has achieved much for humanity, but as any business scales in size it becomes clear the goals of that body conflicts with the goals of those it claims to serve.<br/>
<br/>
As society becomes more aware of these troubles, corporations try to hide their goal of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> because we understand Scarcity keeps <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>, and therefore striving to perpetuate <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the very basis of the conflict between <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion and Consumption.<br/>
<br/>
It may seem there could be no solution since those who <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itionally <a href="fund.htm">Fund</a> <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion demand <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as a Return for the Risk they take.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are operating under the paradigm of "Exchange Value" which requires some a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of scarcity to keep <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>..<br/>
<br/>
Let's re-examine our assumptions about who should <a href="fund.htm">Fund</a> and therefore <a href="own.htm">Own</a> the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
Let's look at the most trivial case of a single person <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing a fruit tree for his <a href="own.htm">own</a> benefit.<br/>
<br/>
He must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, including Wages if he does not do the <a href="work.htm">work</a> himself.<br/>
<br/>
But he cannot <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> *more* than <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>, for who would he <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> it to?<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is defined as <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> but if he does not sell the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is undefined.<br/>
<br/>
So he <a href="fund.htm">Fund</a>ed that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and <a href="own.htm">Own</a>s those means for the expected return of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t instead of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was "<a href="use.htm">Use</a> Value" <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion instead of "Exchange Value".&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not benefit this <a href="own.htm">own</a>er when other orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a>s fail in the area unless he resorts to selling that which he would have eaten.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>..<br/>
<br/>
This is all very obvious and might seem unimportant, but let's push the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a a bit further and see what happens:<br/>
<br/>
<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine now, instead of a single <a href="fund.htm">Fund</a>er-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>er-<a href="user.htm">User</a>, we have thousands of such inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s pooling <a href="fund.htm">Fund</a>s toward an orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a>.<br/>
<br/>
By attracting potential <a href="user.htm">User</a>s to pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for the goods they predict they will need, we can <a href="use.htm">use</a> those <a href="fund.htm">Fund</a>s to buy the means necessary for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="user.htm">User</a>s and <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers will then be the very same set.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t will not be sold because the ROI for the Risk is <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t itself which they attain at <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>..<br/>
<br/>
This solves the '<a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ic' case where the number of <a href="user.htm">User</a>s matches exactly the output of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
But many of these consuming inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s will want to over-<a href="own.htm">own</a> by some percentage to guarantee they have enough <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t at the round of each <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
We must do something with that surplus or it will rot.<br/>
<br/>
We can sell those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts for <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> - as much as the market will bear - but to keep the organization <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by the <a href="user.htm">User</a>s of those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts, we must treat the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as an investment from the <a href="user.htm">User</a> who paid it so they also gain <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>...<br/>
<br/>
In the attached <a href="pic.htm">pic</a>ture "Capitalism.png" we see inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s in the upper-<a href="left.htm">left</a> corner <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and receiving <a href="title.htm">Title</a> to those Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
All <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s, including <a href="work.htm">Work</a>er wages, are initially paid from that pool of <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing.<br/>
<br/>
The Consumer <small>(in blue)</small> begins to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing for those <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s in his <small>(late)</small> quest to buy <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects.<br/>
<br/>
Over time, if the business is successful, the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s receive all they had initially put forward and then begin receiving the special value called <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The Consumer never gains any <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in his <a href="own.htm">own</a> Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es under this arrangement.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the attached <a href="pic.htm">pic</a>ture "Patched-Capitalism.png" we see again see inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s in the upper-<a href="left.htm">left</a> corner <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and receiving <a href="title.htm">Title</a> to those Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es, but this time the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s are *also* Consumers of the future <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are taking risk for the purpose of receiving at-<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t under their full control.<br/>
<br/>
After each round of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion, the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects are not sold <small>(except in cases of surplus)</small>, because they are already the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of those who will consume them.<br/>
<br/>
The heavy line indicates there is no transfer of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, but shows the <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ers are already the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers without any need to purchase since they paid all the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and are the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers as a side-effect of their <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom of the <a href="pic.htm">pic</a>ture shows a Consumer with insufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership buying <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects late and probably <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
But in this case, that overpayment is treated as an investment from the Consumer who paid it - causing him to unwittingly <a href="fund.htm">Fund</a> the purchase and care of even *more* Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es that will eventually begin <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing and therefore provide him with that which he needs.<br/>
<br/>
This allows the organization to grow and yet remain distributed as all <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is 'reflected' <a href="back.htm">back</a> to those willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for that growth.<br/>
<br/>
In systems theory this is <a href="know.htm">know</a>n as a negative-feed<a href="back.htm">back</a> loop.<br/>
<br/>

<hr/><span class="date">Jan-03-2011:</span> The Next <a href="net.htm">Net</a><br/>
We, the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s, already <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of the physical layer *and* we also <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> because of our lack of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
This proves we could afford to buy or <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d our <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> if we could learn to cooperate - since we already <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all those bills and more!<br/>
<br/>
So those who are willing and able to prepay can be <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers and receive at-<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> access under our collective control.<br/>
<br/>
That solves the '<a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ic' case.<br/>
<br/>
The 'dynamic' case is the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult <a href="part.htm">part</a>, but I think I have discovered a solution.<br/>
<br/>
So, to allow us to grow without suffering the usual problems of over accumulation and concentration of power, let's try the following:<br/>
<br/>
Let's allow all all late-comers who have not yet paid enough to purchase access from us as they already do from the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent corporations - and even <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> when the "market will bear", *but* under the strict condition that we treat that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as an investment from the <a href="user.htm">user</a> who paid it - so they too can gain the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership needed to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> themselves from the collective we.<br/>
<br/>
Handling <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er investment creates a negative-feed<a href="back.htm">back</a> loop that auto-distributes control into the hands of those willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for it.<br/>
