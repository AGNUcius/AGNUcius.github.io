<br/>
If you say "But what can we do?" my answer is "We <small>(the consumers)</small> must organize and <a href="own.htm">OWN</a> some physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es ourselves that are constrained by the rule that all <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> be treated as consumer investment so that control remains in our hands."<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for your time and please do not give up - these <small>(probably strange sounding)</small> concepts are in perfect alignment with all of your <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ed goals, it is just not yet clear to you in what way they are pertinent.<br/>

Subject: WHY doesn't the media support Ron Paul?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">"'The media is <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed and controlled by the same powerful <a href="bank.htm">bank</a>ing interests that <a href="own.htm">own</a> and control the Federal Reserve. The media is <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by larger corporations such as General Electric, which are in turn <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by the elite <a href="bank.htm">bank</a>ing cabal. The elite control government officials through bribes and black<a href="mail.htm">mail</a>. The elite <a href="use.htm">use</a> their <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of corporate media outlets to dumb down Americans until the people have no way to fathom how their constitutional rights are being systematically eroded.<br/>
<br/>
"How fortunate for governments that the people they <a href="admin.htm">admin</a>ister don’t think." — Adolf Hitler<br/>
<br/>
So, why doesn't the media support Ron Paul?<br/>
<br/>
He tells the truth so it’s no wonder that when a person like Ron Paul comes along and tells the truth about the Federal Reserve and the Iraq war that the established media doesn’t want the People to hear his message. All those talking heads who downplay or criticize Paul are either paid agents of the elite or are themselves dumbed down to the point where they can’t recognize someone trying to <a href="free.htm">free</a> them of their chains.<br/>
<br/>
HIDING THE POLICE <a href="stat.htm">STAT</a>E As more and more <a href="cam.htm">cam</a>eras are place everywhere you go <small>(buses, taxis, subways, sides of <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>dings, etc)</small> do the “talking heads” warn us that a society is being <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>t where you feel self regulated because you <a href="know.htm">know</a> you’re under 24 hour watch? Do they warn you that you’ll be <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>ing within a self-imposed prison without bars? Do they warn you that the <a href="cam.htm">cam</a>eras are there to <a href="moni.htm">moni</a>tor your behavior? Nope. The truth is hidden through media censorship. Sure, the media tells us “what” is happening, but they don’t help people understand the “why”, the implications it all has for a future police <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e right here in the “<a href="land.htm">land</a> of the <a href="free.htm">free</a>”. Did you <a href="know.htm">know</a> that: * <a href="cam.htm">Cam</a>eras are being <a href="install.htm">install</a>ed that shout at you if you’re doing something wrong? * Cell phone companies can track you through your phone and the technology will soon be hooked into every police de<a href="part.htm">part</a>ment and car? * You will be body scanned for the “right” to travel? * You will be listened to in your home through your <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter or cable/satellite box? * You will be watched in your <a href="own.htm">own</a> home.<br/>
<br/>
LET’S <a href="restor.htm">RESTOR</a>E THE REPUBLIC! These are reasons why it’s up to the people to get Ron Paul’s message out. He wants to take the <a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>e out of our <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>es and <a href="restor.htm">restor</a>e the Republic that the founding fathers gave us. Why doesn’t the media support Ron Paul? Because he isn’t one of the run-of-the-mill corrupt officials in the US government, willing to do the bidding of those with the <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y powers. "The original American patriots were those individuals brave enough to resist with force the oppressive power of King George. I accept the definition of patriotism as that effort to resist oppressive <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e power. The true patriot is motivated by a sense of responsibility and out of self-interest for himself, his family, and the future of his country to resist government abuse of power. He rejects the notion that patriotism means obedience to the <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e." - Ron Paul<br/>
<br/>
EDUCATE YOURSELF!<br/>
<br/>
The people who are the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers in America are being scammed by the <a href="bank.htm">bank</a>ing elite and Ron Paul is trying to expose the scam. While the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers slave away in their little shack homes, the <a href="bank.htm">bank</a>ers create <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y from nothing and steal the wealth of the <a href="land.htm">land</a> through the Federal Reserve, the illegal United <a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>es central <a href="bank.htm">bank</a>. The <a href="bank.htm">bank</a>ers <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e nothing and contribute nothing but misery and slavery to the people. Educate yourself on why your debt is impossible to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> off because the interest must be paid with more borrowed <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y.<br/>
<br/>
It's time to wake up and do a little reading!!!'"</span><br/>

<span class="quot">> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> has been successfully yoked to questions of utility</span><br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> occurs when consumer <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e is more than <a href="own.htm">own</a>er <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
One <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> an <a href="own.htm">own</a>er <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s is all wages paid to <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers who operated the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es during that round to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e, transport, <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>e and sell.<br/>
<br/>
Other <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s include the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es an <a href="own.htm">own</a>er paid and continues to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s to buy, <a href="install.htm">install</a>, manage, operate, maintain and <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es and their <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects.<br/>
<br/>
It is common to claim <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is reward for taking the risk of investing, but is there no end to it?&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> measures the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t consumer's dependence on the business <a href="own.htm">own</a>er.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an inverse measure of that society's development.<br/>
<br/>
Physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers may sell the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects of those <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es for more than it <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wages paid for <a href="work.htm">work</a> are one of those <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
But <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is not wages, and it is not <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment for <a href="work.htm">work</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the ability to leverage the consumer to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> more than the <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion through withholding access to the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
Now, you might say "There are no true monopolys because anyone can always just <a href="start.htm">start</a> another business."<br/>
<br/>
This reasoning admits that competition is only between <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers cannot compete because they do not have access to the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
