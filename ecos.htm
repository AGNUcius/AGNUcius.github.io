Yes, that is Capitalism, the Kernel for most <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent<br/>

DOS might be the best comparison - where any single<br/>
process <small>(person)</small> might take all the bandwidth <small>(water?)</small><br/>
or all the memory <small>(<a href="land.htm">land</a>?)</small> while all other processes<br/>
are 'starved' <small>(that's the <a href="real.htm">real</a> CS term)</small> of the inputs<br/>
they need to survive.<br/>
<br/>
Now something like VMS, or a knockoff == WNT <small>(that's<br/>
Windows NT)</small> take a much more Dictatorial approach -<br/>
where a central command-center decides what Process<br/>
will get the next slice of CPU or Pie.<br/>
<br/>
What I envision is an allocation scheme <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>t around<br/>
the understanding that any Process <small>(legal entity)</small><br/>
that has been allocated <small>(<a href="own.htm">own</a>s)</small> quite a bit of RAM <small>(<a href="land.htm">land</a>)</small><br/>

Let's say you and some others are <a href="start.htm">start</a>ing a community in an isolated region, is<a href="land.htm">land</a> or planet.<br/>
<br/>
Who will decide how to utilize the scarce things such as the <a href="land.htm">land</a>, water, <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful plants and animals, tools and other supplies?<br/>
<br/>
If nobody decides and there is no communication about plans or goals, those re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es may be accidentally squandered or <a href="use.htm">use</a>d much less efficiently than possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;Efficiency is important because poverty is when the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is too high.<br/>
<br/>
This is similar to the problem of scheduling and allocation for <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="curr.htm">Curr</a>ent <a href="pop.htm">pop</a>ular OS kernels <small>(such as Linux, Solaris, NT+, etc.)</small> are designed as benevolent dictators that keep central control of the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es such as CPU, RAM, <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>-drive, <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>, etc.<br/>
<br/>
A more primitive <a href="operating system.htm">Operating System</a> kernel such as <a href="free.htm">Free</a>DOS is more like Capitalism - where any process or group of procs may seize all or most of one or more physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es and then "starve" or "kill" any other procs by setting the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e of access too high.&nbsp;&nbsp;These wealthy <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers also control the containing government and create <a href="new.htm">new</a> legislation <small>(<a href="new.htm">new</a> code)</small> to further <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e their holdings.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es is in the hands of those who organize and invest early.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not that those industrious individuals or groups are 'evil', it is only that we each find ourselves in a "prisoner's dilemma" which encourages each <a href="own.htm">own</a>er to <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> _against_ the rest of the community instead of choosing allowing control and growth to flow according to that consumers investment <small>(<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course these wealthy processes have the 'right' to refuse other procs "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" access, but this division can also be viewed as an inefficiency that ignorantly thwarts the perfected competition that comes through "<a href="user own.htm">user own</a>ership" which would perfect competition.<br/>
