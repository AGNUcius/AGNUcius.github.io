A friend of mine recently wrote:<br/>
<span class="quot">> At what point did</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> someone say, "let's all get <a href="job.htm">job</a>s, and spend all of our time away from our</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> family just to put a roof over our head that we could just <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d ourselves? </span><br/>
<span class="quot">> And food on the table that we could have grown ourselves?"</span><br/>
<br/>
Does the word "ourselves" mean:<br/>
1. Each person must fend for themselves in solitary confinement.<br/>
<br/>
2. A group of people <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing together.<br/>
<br/>
If #1 <small>(I doubt it)</small>, then tell me your thoughts on <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ing <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s in general.<br/>
<br/>
If #2, then how large can the group become before there is trouble?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
In other words, why are humans unable to 'scale' society <small>(a group of people)</small>, and when does the breakdown begin?&nbsp;&nbsp;At what number of humans, or under what conditions does <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e become a negative instead of a positive?<br/>
<br/>
If we uncover the mechanical failure in our organizing, doesn't it seem likely we could 'fix' that problem and then begin to outcooperate the capitalists?<br/>
<br/>
Are food and shelter <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly as expensive as we are sold?&nbsp;&nbsp;If not, then where is the re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e leak?<br/>

Attempting to setup an alternate form of hosting seems to imply there is something wrong with just buying or <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ing <a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e and tools as people normally do.<br/>
<br/>
I <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> there is a problem.<br/>

Could each of you please write your high-level description of that problem?<br/>
<br/>
Try to keep the description 'mechanical' in nature - avoiding emotional terms such as "evil" or "greed".<br/>

In what way are we <small>(the collective processes)</small> failing to <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ly allocate and schedule those re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es?<br/>

Cultivating the conditions for meaningful encounters, conversations, <a href="collab.htm">collab</a>orations and innovation requires at least <a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e, and probably tools.<br/>
<br/>
My hosting inspiration is in how the "we" can treat <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of some <a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e and tools so goals similar to Illich's can surface.<br/>
<br/>
The primary problem I see is how originators that purchase <a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e and tools accidentally retain too much control while newcomers cannot gain a foothold.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="spac.htm">Spac</a>e and tools have <a href="real.htm">real</a> and re<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ing <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s that must be collected from the <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipants in some manner - a kind of 'tax' or '<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>' needed to cover the expenses of operation so hosting can continue.<br/>
<br/>
The solution I <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ose - to <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership &lt;i><span class="itlc">flows</span>&lt;/i> as the organization grows - is to understand all "<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" <small>(or what is commonly called "<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>")</small> is a plea for growth from the <a href="user.htm">user</a> who paid it, and must be handled as an investment from that <a href="user.htm">user</a> toward more <a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e and tools.<br/>
<br/>
As those investments &lt;b><span class="bold">vest</span>&lt;/b> to the <a href="user.htm">user</a> who paid them, <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of the <a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e and tools needed for effective hosting are shared among the <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipants in a self-balancing manner.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="user.htm">User</a>s who <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> more than <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> slowly gain <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<a href="user.htm">User</a>s who <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> exactly <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> retain <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<a href="user.htm">User</a>s who <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> less than <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> slowly lose <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
Does this seem relevant, or would you say the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of hosting facilities is unimportant?<br/>
