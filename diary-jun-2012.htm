<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the need for <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y within the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> is reduced in<br/>
two ways:<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts are not bought or sold <small>(except surplus)</small><br/>
because they are already the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of the people<br/>
who will <a href="use.htm">use</a> them.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> Wages are not paid in the <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional sense<br/>
because we barter <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s before <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion begins.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But people will need plain-old-<a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y for as long as<br/>
the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts they want are not yet fully Vertically<br/>
Integrated within the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
I think the most common transition will be for<br/>
subgroups to initially purchase off-site <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts in<br/>
bulk to "tide them over" while also slowly investing<br/>
in the MoP for that <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For example, if you like hamburgers, then you will<br/>
group-up with others to buy beef-calves and alfalfa<br/>
seed and salt-licks and even finally salt mines; but<br/>
until those things can be aquired and fully<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive, you might also want to buy cases of frozen<br/>
hamburgers from some off-site farmer or even just a<br/>
regular grocery <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>e or wherever.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> You mentioned <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>ding our <a href="own.htm">own</a> ISP...&nbsp;&nbsp;we need some</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> entry point into that <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> which is likely to be</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> a utility service provided by the extant capitalist</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> system.&nbsp;&nbsp;But where does the <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y for interfacing in</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> these ways come from?</span><br/>
<br/>
In nearly every case, for nearly every <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t, The<br/>
<a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y will mostly come from middle-income consumers<br/>
who can pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for that <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t in bulk and also<br/>
toward buying the MoP to wean ourselves off of the<br/>
Capitalist providers.<br/>
<br/>
In the example of an ISP, we organize neighborhoods of<br/>
consumers to pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for the equipment needed to<br/>
connect their houses to each other, and then subscribe<br/>
to the ISP through a "business grade" connection that<br/>
is split among them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> What about other vital services and <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts? Such</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> as those related to personal transportation;</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> What about healthcare? It is fine to</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> suggest that someone with a degree in medicine</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> -should- provide those services for the <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>e of</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> future repayment from patients, yet this kind of</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>e does not provide any financial liability</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> buffer against legal action involved in malpractice</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> disputes.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> Even IF you manage to construct an</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> effective legal barrier against such actions, what</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> recourse is there for those who feel they have been</span><br/>

<span class="quot">> legal barrier allow any person claiming to have</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> medical <a href="know.htm">know</a>ledge or experience practice without</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> qualification?&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't get me wrong; I am all about</span><br/>

<span class="quot">> we can take in that direction?</span><br/>
<br/>
Here are my rough thoughts:<br/>
<br/>
0. Pre-<a href="boot.htm">Boot</a> Stage:<br/>
<br/>
Determine minimum size and complexity needed for basic<br/>
food and shelter of occupants.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="ide.htm">Ide</a>ntify symbiotic plant, animal and fungus species<br/>

trailers, bulk food, paper, <a href="use.htm">use</a>d clothes, etc. needed<br/>
to sustain the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers during the Growth Stage.<br/>
<br/>
Crowd-<a href="fund.htm">Fund</a>ers receive <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a><br/>

<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers also receive <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a><br/>

<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers are paid initially with a "Basic Outcome"<br/>
consisting of bare essentials such as tent or trailer<br/>
housing and cafeteria-style meals.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1. <a href="boot.htm">Boot</a> Stage:<br/>
<br/>
Purchase the assets needed to begin.<br/>
<br/>
'Hire' the <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers by having them sign contracts to<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a> a certain number of hours per week or <small>(better)</small>,<br/>
to achieve certain goals within some time-frame.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers receive more or less <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership depending<br/>
upon how much they commit to achieve as measured by<br/>
others within the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> that need those services.<br/>
<br/>
All inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s <small>(whether Crowd-<a href="fund.htm">Fund</a>ers <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>ing offsite or<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>ing onsite)</small> must continue to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the<br/>
re<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ing <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion or slowly lose <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership<br/>
as their portion of the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> is sold to cover those<br/>
<a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers usually <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> re<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ing <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s with labor.<br/>
<br/>
Crowd-<a href="fund.htm">Fund</a>ers usually <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> re<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ing <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s with <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y<br/>
<a href="use.htm">use</a>d to buy assets that we are not yet able to<br/>
generate onsite <small>(because we are not yet fully<br/>
Vertically Integrated)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2. Growth Stage:<br/>
<br/>
As the agriculture begins to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e, most of the<br/>
output is not sold, but is already the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of<br/>
each inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a> according to the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> the did commit.<br/>
<br/>
Most inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s will eventually have surplus<br/>
<small>(especially after a few years of growth and natural<br/>
regeneration of species)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Each inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a> can choose to do whatever they like with<br/>
their <a href="own.htm">own</a> surplus except for one specific constraint:<br/>
"<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> must be treated as <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er Investment".<br/>
<br/>
For example, say you have 100 extra lbs of Olives.<br/>
You can turn these into oil and try to burn them in a<br/>
diesel engine, or you can offer them as a sacrifice to<br/>
your God, or you can sell them to your neighbor *but*<br/>
if you sell them, you must treat any a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> above<br/>
<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s as though the buyer had made an investment in<br/>
the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Separating <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> from Wages is a bit complicated, so<br/>
I will try talk-out how that <a href="work.htm">work</a>s:<br/>
<br/>
If you do the <a href="work.htm">work</a> of selling the Olives, then you can<br/>
claim that everything the buyer paid beyond any other<br/>
<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s you may have in<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ed is your Wages for doing<br/>
that <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
That is completely fine, even if it seems you are<br/>
overpaying yourself.<br/>
<br/>
But if you hire someone to sell the Olives, or <small>(and<br/>
this next case will be the most common)</small> if you just<br/>
let the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>ehouse sell any of your surplus for<br/>
you, then those <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers will be paid wages that are<br/>
easily separated from <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>s, and so all you will<br/>
receive are all <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s needed to cover that<br/>
over<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion - so you will "break even" with regards<br/>
to any surplus.<br/>
<br/>
This will cause most people to <a href="own.htm">own</a> only approximately<br/>
as much in each <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> as they need the<br/>
outputs - though most people will likely want to <a href="own.htm">own</a><br/>
just a little bit more as a sort of '<a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance'<br/>
against the possibility lean years of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion<br/>
caused by drought or pestilence, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<hr/><span class="date">Jun-23-2012:</span> <br/>
We, the people, <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for all <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion in the end, but we <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> *late*, and so do not <a href="own.htm">own</a> the Means of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, and so must continually beg those <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers to do what we wish - even though they cannot comply because they seek to keep <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> which requires we be subjugated.<br/>
<br/>
Why will we not organize for our mutual benefit?<br/>
<br/>
We already <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the initial and re<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ing <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s *and* we even <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> more when we <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, and yet we still have no control.<br/>
<br/>
If we, as consumers, would pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts and <a href="use.htm">use</a> that <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y to buy and <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> farms and factories and <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>s for the purpose of accepting the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t as the return on investment, then we would finally have the control we seek, and <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> would be undefined <small>(since the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t is not sold when it is already <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by those who will consume it)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Come on, let's stop begging the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers and group together to <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> the <a href="land.htm">land</a> and water and plants and animals we need to <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>e without <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing tribute to the billionaire feudalists.<br/>

I am talking about *group* <a href="free.htm">free</a>doms, which are much<br/>

<small>(only for the specific <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts they want)</small>, but since<br/>
they will not buy the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t from us <small>(they each <a href="own.htm">own</a><br/>

<br/>
<br/>
We will attract <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers to commit to labor in the<br/>
future <small>(<a href="promis.htm">promis</a>e to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> with <a href="work.htm">work</a>)</small> in return for their<br/>

<br/>
Those <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers are also consumers, and will become <a href="real.htm">real</a><br/>
<a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers of the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>, and so will <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
We will not <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the consumers or the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers with <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y.<br/>
<br/>
We will not <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the consumers or the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers with <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
These inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s receive <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t as a "side-effect" of<br/>
their <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ing the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
For example, the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of a milk-cow does not *buy*<br/>
the milk from himself, he <a href="own.htm">own</a>s it already.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, the <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers of a milk dairy do not *buy*<br/>
the milk from themselves, they each <a href="own.htm">own</a> their % already.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We can accomplish this without begging politicians.<br/>
<br/>
We can organized in small groups that buy and <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a><br/>
the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion very much like any business or<br/>
organization, but with the following Terms of<br/>
Operation as self-enforced constraints:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t is the Inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>'s Return. This means<br/>
Consumers will micro-invest by pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing for results,<br/>
become <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers of that business and receive the<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t itself as a side-effect of that <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er's Investment. This means<br/>
late-coming Consumers will overpay for <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t as<br/>
usual, but we will treat <small>(at least some % of)</small> that<br/>
value as though they had invested as described in #1.<br/>
<br/>
3.)</small> Investments are commitments of Future Labor and<br/>
Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means we will issue a<br/>
deposit-based, <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ing <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency <a href="back.htm">back</a>ed by both the<br/>
<a href="land.htm">land</a> and tools and other inputs, plus the <a href="work.htm">work</a> needed<br/>
to transform those assets into a <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
These adjustments allow us to move away from excessive<br/>
token-<a href="pass.htm">pass</a>ing and toward <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tivity that can safely<br/>
reach stasis - eliminating the perceived need for<br/>
infinite growth.<br/>
<br/>

I want to <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d an alternate situation that can grow to cover the entire Earth.<br/>
<br/>
I want to <a href="work.htm">work</a> with people like you to do almost the same as what you are doing, but before I can put my hands in the dirt <small>(and that is <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly where I want them)</small>, I must have a comprehensive plan to assure the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers gain the security that only <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership can offer.<br/>
<br/>
Every <a href="work.htm">work</a>er <small>(and all of that person's "dependents")</small> needs food and housing and basic health-care and clothing and basic utilities, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Of course we don't want to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers with Federal Reserve <a href="note.htm">Note</a>s, but <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing them with goods and services is not quite right either.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers must become *<a href="real.htm">real</a>* <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers in the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion for each of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts they need <small>(this is consumer-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ed, not <a href="work.htm">work</a>er-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ed)</small>, and must also commit to <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e labor with others within the "<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <a href="arena.htm">Arena</a>" if they intend to benefit from specialization.<br/>
<br/>
This means we must have a minimum a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of "Horizontal Diversity" to meet all the variety of <small>(at least basic)</small> needs for every <a href="work.htm">work</a>er.<br/>
<br/>
For example, we need to <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d a dentist office and buy/<a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d the tools for simple dental procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;We must attract or train someone that can operate those tools, and who is willing to commit to do that <a href="work.htm">work</a> for the '<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>' of gaining <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership in the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion for his housing, food, clothing, transportation, sanitation, etc. combined with commitments of others to operate those MoP for his benefit in return for his fixing their teeth.<br/>
<br/>
We must also <a href="work.htm">work</a> toward "Vertical Integration" to move away from the need to <a href="use.htm">use</a> external tokens.<br/>
For example, we might buy chicken-feed at first, but must grow those plants to avoid the need to buy.<br/>
Vertical Integration is a very long-term goal, and we won't <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> mines or factories right away, but will just buy shovels from China at first.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="part.htm">Part</a> of the initial <a href="start.htm">start</a>up <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s can be collected from middle-income consumers who are willing to pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for organic goods.<br/>
<br/>
Each person would invest just enough <small>(either <a href="land.htm">Land</a>, Capital or Labor)</small> to cover the predicted <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion for the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t they each intend to <a href="use.htm">use</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Each of these inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s would still need to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> their % of the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s as usual, but since they would accept the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t itself as the return for that risk, there would be sale, and so <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> would not exist at all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here is the rough business <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el:<br/>
----<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t is the Inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>'s Return.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means Consumers will micro-invest by pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing for results, become <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers of that business and receive the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t itself as a side-effect of that <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

The robots are coming, The robots are coming!<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e of Nevada began issuing licenses for driverless vehicles last month.<br/>
<br/>
Fully robotic dairies have been operational for a few years now.<br/>
<br/>
Robots are <a href="pic.htm">pic</a>king nuts and berries and some other <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
Foxconn <small>(<a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ers of iPad, etc.)</small> will be replacing many <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers with 1 Million robots in a few years.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> in these simple industries can already be accomplished without human interaction.<br/>
<br/>
So <a href="back.htm">back</a> to the question of *WHO* should <a href="own.htm">own</a> the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion...<br/>
<br/>
If Willie Nelson <small>(and Karl Marx, and anyone wishing for a <a href="work.htm">Work</a>er-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ed society)</small> is right, then what in the world will we do when it takes only a few people to supply 1 million loaves of bread?<br/>
<br/>
Are we sure the consumers must not have any <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership?<br/>
<br/>
If the consumers were to <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> the farms and factories, and if they were to accept the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t as the ROI, then there would be no sale, and so <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e and <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> would be the same, and <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> would be *undefined*.<br/>
<br/>
Why are we so frightened of <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership for our mutual benefit?<br/>
<br/>
As consumers, we already <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion anyway ... AND we <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;So clearly we could afford to be the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.<br/>
