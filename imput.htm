<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion requires <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es and <a href="skill.htm">Skill</a>s<br/>
1.)</small> <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in <a href="land.htm">land</a> and water rights.<br/>
2.)</small> Heirloom plants and animals for food, medicine, <a href="soap.htm">soap</a>, cloth, <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>ding materials.<br/>
3.)</small> Tools, and eventually the tools to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e tools.<br/>
4.)</small> <a href="skill.htm">Skill</a>s applied to these <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es to create <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Swapping <a href="skill.htm">Skill</a>s happens *before* <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion begins, while Bartering <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts happens at the point-of-sale - long after <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is completed.<br/>
<br/>
Bartering <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts suffers from the "simultaneous coincidence of wants" problem because it occurs far too late, and so there is not enough time to resolve the "chain of exchange".<br/>
<br/>
By "chain of exchange" I mean the list of people required to 'connect' the <a href="work.htm">work</a>-commitments of one person to the <a href="work.htm">work</a>-commitments of some other person.<br/>
<br/>
When Swapping <a href="skill.htm">Skill</a>s, <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers commit to <a href="work.htm">work</a> in the *future* for others <small>(say <a href="pic.htm">pic</a>king apples)</small> in exchange for someone else committing to <a href="work.htm">work</a> in the *future* for them <small>(say <a href="pic.htm">pic</a>king oranges)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
This gives us time to resolve the "chain of exchange" needed for that <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e to occur and so do not need to <a href="pass.htm">pass</a> tokens <small>(receive Wages)</small> - though we will need to track whether <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers fulfill those commitments.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is a growth-vector we can 'reflect' toward the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er as his investment in even more Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion - so the growth of the organization is continuously redistributed to those willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for the growth and then continuation of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
We can change the system from within by regaining control of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
This is an ancient and continuing struggle for our planet.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion is already taking place, but it is controlled by those who seek <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
But to seek <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is to seek scarcity, because <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> *requires* scarcity.<br/>
<br/>
As a farm-boy in Idaho, my dad told me about a US government program that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s farmers to keep <a href="land.htm">land</a> out of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion to increase scarcity so <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e remains above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
Those farmers, and most all entrepreneurs are in such debt that most of the <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s are <a href="pass.htm">pass</a>ed along to <a href="bank.htm">bank</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
To seek <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is to seek scarcity.<br/>
<br/>
We must buy, <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> and occupy the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty required to host the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of our continuing needs.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span> Needs: Food, Housing, Health-Care, Child-Care/Education, Transportation, Communication<br/>
<br/>
Consumers already <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, and they also <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> because of our lack of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
This proves we could afford to buy or <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d our <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> if we could learn to cooperate - since we already <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all those bills and more!<br/>
<br/>
So those who are willing and able to prepay can be <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers and receive at-<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> access under our collective control.<br/>
<br/>
That solves the '<a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ic' case.<br/>
<br/>
The 'dynamic' case is the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult <a href="part.htm">part</a>, but I think I have discovered a solution.<br/>
<br/>
So, to allow us to grow without suffering the usual problems of over accumulation and concentration of power, let's try the following:<br/>
<br/>
Let's allow all all late-comers who have not yet paid enough to purchase access from us as they already do from the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent corporations - and even <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> when the "market will bear", *but* under the strict condition that we treat that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as an investment from the <a href="user.htm">user</a> who paid it - so they too can gain the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership needed to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> themselves from the collective we.<br/>
<br/>
Handling <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er investment creates a negative-feed<a href="back.htm">back</a> loop that auto-distributes control into the hands of those willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let's re-examine our assumptions about who should <a href="fund.htm">Fund</a> and therefore <a href="own.htm">Own</a> the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
Let's look at the most trivial case of a single person <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing a fruit tree for his <a href="own.htm">own</a> benefit.<br/>
<br/>
He must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, including Wages if he does not do the <a href="work.htm">work</a> himself.<br/>
<br/>
But he cannot <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> *more* than <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>, for who would he <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> it to?<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is defined as <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> but if he does not sell the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is undefined.<br/>
<br/>
So he <a href="fund.htm">Fund</a>ed that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and <a href="own.htm">Own</a>s those means for the expected return of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t instead of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was "<a href="use.htm">Use</a> Value" <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion instead of "Exchange Value".&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not benefit this <a href="own.htm">own</a>er when other orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a>s fail in the area unless he resorts to selling that which he would have eaten.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>..<br/>
<br/>
This is all very obvious and might seem unimportant, but let's push the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a a bit further and see what happens:<br/>
<br/>
<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine now, instead of a single <a href="fund.htm">Fund</a>er-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>er-<a href="user.htm">User</a>, we have thousands of such inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s pooling <a href="fund.htm">Fund</a>s toward an orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a>.<br/>
<br/>
By attracting potential <a href="user.htm">User</a>s to pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for the goods they predict they will need, we can <a href="use.htm">use</a> those <a href="fund.htm">Fund</a>s to buy the means necessary for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="user.htm">User</a>s and <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers will then be the very same set.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t will not be sold because the ROI for the Risk is <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t itself which they attain at <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>..<br/>
<br/>
This solves the '<a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ic' case where the number of <a href="user.htm">User</a>s matches exactly the output of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
But many of these consuming inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s will want to over-<a href="own.htm">own</a> by some percentage to guarantee they have enough <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t at the round of each <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
We must do something with that surplus or it will rot.<br/>
<br/>
We can sell those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts for <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> - as much as the market will bear - but to keep the organization <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by the <a href="user.htm">User</a>s of those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts, we must treat the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as an investment from the <a href="user.htm">User</a> who paid it so they also gain <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>...<br/>
<br/>
In the attached <a href="pic.htm">pic</a>ture "Capitalism.png" we see inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s in the upper-<a href="left.htm">left</a> corner <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and receiving <a href="title.htm">Title</a> to those Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
All <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s, including <a href="work.htm">Work</a>er wages, are initially paid from that pool of <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing.<br/>
<br/>
The Consumer <small>(in blue)</small> begins to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing for those <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s in his <small>(late)</small> quest to buy <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects.<br/>
<br/>
Over time, if the business is successful, the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s receive all they had initially put forward and then begin receiving the special value called <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The Consumer never gains any <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in his <a href="own.htm">own</a> Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es under this arrangement.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the attached <a href="pic.htm">pic</a>ture "Patched-Capitalism.png" we see again see inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s in the upper-<a href="left.htm">left</a> corner <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and receiving <a href="title.htm">Title</a> to those Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es, but this time the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s are *also* Consumers of the future <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are taking risk for the purpose of receiving at-<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t under their full control.<br/>
<br/>
After each round of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion, the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects are not sold <small>(except in cases of surplus)</small>, because they are already the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of those who will consume them.<br/>
<br/>
The heavy line indicates there is no transfer of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, but shows the <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ers are already the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers without any need to purchase since they paid all the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and are the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers as a side-effect of their <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom of the <a href="pic.htm">pic</a>ture shows a Consumer with insufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership buying <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects late and probably <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
But in this case, that overpayment is treated as an investment from the Consumer who paid it - causing him to unwittingly <a href="fund.htm">Fund</a> the purchase and care of even *more* Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es that will eventually begin <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing and therefore provide him with that which he needs.<br/>
<br/>
This allows the organization to grow and yet remain distributed as all <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is 'reflected' <a href="back.htm">back</a> to those willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for that growth.<br/>
<br/>
In systems theory this is <a href="know.htm">know</a>n as a negative-feed<a href="back.htm">back</a> loop.<br/>

Minimizing the <a href="trad.htm">Trad</a>e of <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects through Predictive Scheduling of Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine an 'auction' setting where non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ing <a href="user.htm">user</a>s bid to <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine at <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> time slots.<br/>
<br/>
In the case where only one person wants the time slot, the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine is <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ed "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>".<br/>
<br/>
When more than one <a href="user.htm">user</a> wants a specific time slot, the auction begins.&nbsp;&nbsp;The winning bidder will have paid <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> <small>(<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>)</small>, which proves the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ware is insufficient to meet peak demand and also proves the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er is willing to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e that investment.<br/>
<br/>
So when a non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ing <a href="user.htm">user</a> <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>s the <a href="mak.htm">Mak</a>erBot for a <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>, the group should allow that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment, but should then queue that <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y toward being invested in yet *another* <a href="mak.htm">Mak</a>erBot instance that the <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er will eventually <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> with other non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers who also <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
This creates a sort of 'conduit' structure where the original Group can safely <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> their equipment to others because they charge enough to cover <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s, while any further <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> collected during auction is <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to grow yet *another* Group that, when finally formed, can safely 'fork' from the other Group and <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e their <a href="own.htm">own</a> choices about how to treat *their* <a href="new.htm">new</a> equipment.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="h2">==Repurposing <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership</span><br/>
WE must be the change we seek, and we can do it through -<br/>
hold onto your hat ... we can do it through <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership!<br/>
<br/>
"What!?" you say, "How can you possibly <a href="use.htm">use</a> something as vicious and<br/>
terrible as Private <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty in a 'good' manner?".<br/>
<br/>
The secret lies in how the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> <a href="use.htm">use</a>s Copyright against itself as Copy<a href="left.htm">left</a>.<br/>
We can <a href="use.htm">use</a> the same pattern in the physical <a href="real.htm">real</a>m as, well, as "<a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty <a href="left.htm">Left</a>".<br/>
<br/>
"<a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty <a href="left.htm">Left</a>" will be a legally-binding document enforcing Social Standards we seek.<br/>
We then organize to co-purchase <a href="land.htm">Land</a> and Tools that we will place under this compact.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Origin and Purpose of Growth</span><br/>
By doing this we give ourselves the opportunity to "do the right<br/>
thing" with <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
But before we can write such a Private Law we will need to understand how groups<br/>
gain <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <small>(how they grow)</small>, and *WHO* should control that <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
Growth occurs when <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e is kept above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
So <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is a very important <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e of Growth.<br/>
<br/>
But what is <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>?&nbsp;&nbsp;Where does it come from?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Origin and Purpose of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a></span><br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> indicates a <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er's lack of <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
When he who eats the fruit is the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er of the tree, then only <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s are paid.<br/>
There is no <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> because there is no Purchase, for the eater <a href="own.htm">own</a>s it already.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This collapses the complexity of exchange down to <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ing only <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s. Customers pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for Goods and Services to become <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
Those with <a href="skill.htm">Skill</a> can <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> with <a href="work.htm">Work</a> if what they offer is wanted in the <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>. While any <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> oc<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ing naturally is treated as <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er Investment in more <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
So growth and clustering is possible, but occurs in an auto-distributed manner. Those *<a href="new.htm">new</a>* <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty holdings are then under the co-command of he who paid.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Implementation</span><br/>
<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers Rule.&nbsp;&nbsp;They can add any arbitrary laws <small>(rules)</small> to their <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
We can <a href="use.htm">use</a> this to our advantage similar to how the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>s our '<a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual' <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty. So let us buy together and <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion needed for our sovereignty.<br/>
<br/>
And then apply a Terms Of Operation as a legally binding Social Compact that defines the negative-feed<a href="back.htm">back</a> loops needed by any Hypervisor when dividing <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ting re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es among otherwise destructively greedy <a href="operating system.htm">Operating System</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
We will design a system of interaction that describes constraints on Exchange. It can be thought of a <a href="free.htm">Free</a> as in <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom <a href="trad.htm">Trad</a>e <a href="agree.htm">Agree</a>ment <small>(FaiFTA)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Through this binding agent we can enforce a bare-minimum set of requirements for Allocation and Scheduling of re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es we hold in 'common'.<br/>
<br/>
It will be a sort of 'Simulated Commons' in that we are explicitly using <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership to <a href="part.htm">part</a>ition the earth into small chunks that we collectively purchase for our <a href="own.htm">own</a> benefit.<br/>

2.)</small> The <a href="land.htm">land</a> is held in perpetuity by a Trust or non-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> corporation, or whatever <small>(I don't <a href="know.htm">know</a> all the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> instruments that can be chosen from)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
3.)</small> The Trust should try to qualify as a non-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> entity to escape <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty taxes that will otherwise punish all improvements.<br/>
<br/>
4.)</small> Doing this will '<a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ualize' access to the <a href="land.htm">Land</a> - allowing individuals and corporations to Lease <a href="part.htm">part</a>s of the whole, but never able to sell any <a href="part.htm">part</a>.<br/>
<br/>
5.)</small> The most important point of this is the structure of those Leases - which can be thought-of as a sort of internal <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty tax - and how they must weigh against *holdings* instead of weighing against improvements.<br/>
<br/>
The concept of "<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er Investment" still applies, and means "Whenever the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of a Lease is more than needed to cover <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s, that overpayment becomes the <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er's <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership in the Trust.<br/>
<br/>
6.)</small> I'm still uncertain if this is sufficient.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've always <a href="imag.htm">imag</a>ined whatever Social Compact we design must also apply to movable <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ed Capital <small>(tools and such)</small>, but am trying to get away from that approach, mostly because it is so <a href="hard.htm">hard</a> to 'police' and 'enforce'.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">==Deposits instead of Debts</span><br/>
The <a href="bank.htm">bank</a>s have fooled us out of the Trust between ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
Any <a href="skill.htm">Skill</a>ed <a href="art.htm">Art</a>isan can issue his <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency as a <a href="promis.htm">Promis</a>e to <a href="work.htm">Work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The "other half" of the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency is the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <small>(<a href="land.htm">Land</a> and Tools)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
These two <a href="part.htm">part</a>s complete the <a href="back.htm">back</a>ing of an <a href="insur.htm">Insur</a>ing, Deposit Based <a href="mone.htm">Mone</a>y.<br/>
<br/>
What is Medical <a href="insur.htm">Insur</a>ance?&nbsp;&nbsp;It is <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership in the <a href="land.htm">Land</a>, <a href="buil.htm">Buil</a>dings and Tools And the 'support' <a href="skill.htm">Skill</a>ed Aritsans needed for that <a href="work.htm">Work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
So we, as groups of groups, can avoid using debt-based <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency within that <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> through *commitments* to each other.<br/>
<br/>
For example, I could *commit* to shovel manure and then <a href="use.htm">use</a> that *commitment* to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for breakfast.<br/>
<br/>
The time it takes for me carry-out that *commitment* increases the 'Interest' against me...<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure what 'Interest' is in this scenario...<br/>
<br/>
Related <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a: Groups of <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers will r<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>nect Credibility with Cr<a href="edit.htm">edit</a> in ... Accr<a href="edit.htm">edit</a>ation Unions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For example, if I co-buy a roto-tiller with some other guys, and supplied 21% of the <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s, then I have 21% of the 'say' when we decide things like "How often should we change the oil?".<br/>
<br/>
For example, We, the <a href="user.htm">User</a>s, will need collectively purchase and/or <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d and then <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> the material infrastructure that our ISPs and Cell-Phone providers hold against us before we can finally have any <a href="real.htm">real</a> say in how those <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>s are governed.<br/>
<br/>
Once we see that <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership can be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d as a force for good, we can then begin to co-buy our way out of subjection.<br/>
<br/>
But such an organization will be very unstable unless we are able to admit the true origin and purpose of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, for otherwise the originators of such a facility will surely treat that <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> as a reward for themselves - which will concentrate power and eventually cause the group to be no <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> from any other Capitalist endeavor.<br/>
<br/>
For example, <a href="imag.htm">imag</a>ine a neighborhood of say 1000 people <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> a Business-Class internet connection from an ISP in the area.<br/>
<br/>
Let's say the <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e the ISP charges is $500/month.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly all these co-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ers have high-speed internet in the US for just $2/month!<br/>
<br/>
We can do this with any and all industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine a Consumer <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ed cell-phone <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
We would only charge ourselves *exactly* what it <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s to send a txt message or a photograph, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We, the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s, already <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of the physical layer *and* we also <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> because of our lack of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
This proves we could afford to buy or <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d our <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> if we could learn to cooperate - since we already <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all those bills and more!<br/>
<br/>
So those who are willing and able to prepay can be <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers and receive at-<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> access under our collective control.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For example, say a group of customers of raw-milk pool their $ and/or labor to purchase and/or <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d a dairy.<br/>
<br/>
Each person invests <small>(whether with <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y or with labor)</small> the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> required for them to receive the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t they intend to consume.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t is never sold since it already belongs to those who will <a href="use.htm">use</a> it.<br/>
<br/>
When each consumer/<a href="own.htm">own</a>er arrives at the dairy to get milk, they do not buy it from the group, but are simply receiving the % that they already <a href="own.htm">own</a> as a result of their <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in those Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <small>(the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es in this case is the <a href="land.htm">Land</a>, Water-rights, Cattle, feedlot, milking <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hines, etc.)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As another example: <a href="imag.htm">imag</a>ine co-owing the material assets of a cell-phone <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Attract 1/2 million potential phone/internet customers to pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for such services.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="use.htm">Use</a> those <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s to buy, <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d and operate those Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>off is that we "avoid <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>" instead of trying to collect <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> from others.<br/>
<br/>
That solves the '<a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ic' case.<br/>
<br/>
The 'dynamic' case is the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult <a href="part.htm">part</a>, but I think I have discovered a solution.<br/>
<br/>
So, to allow us to grow without suffering the usual problems of over accumulation and concentration of power, let's try the following:<br/>
<br/>
Let's allow all all late-comers who have not yet paid enough to purchase access from us as they already do from the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent corporations - and even <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> when the "market will bear", *but* under the strict condition that we treat that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as an investment from the <a href="user.htm">user</a> who paid it - so they too can gain the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership needed to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> themselves from the collective we.<br/>
<br/>
Handling <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er investment creates a negative-feed<a href="back.htm">back</a> loop that auto-distributes control into the hands of those willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
An alternate <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing scheme would have some % of the <a href="start.htm">start</a>up <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s come from potential End-<a href="user.htm">User</a>s "prepaying" for those results.<br/>
<br/>
These <a href="user.htm">User</a>-Inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s would receive a <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>out of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t instead of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
They would not buy the outputs, but would <a href="own.htm">own</a> them already as a side-effect of their <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ing the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Attract middle-to-high income households to *prepay* for organic foods.<br/>
<br/>
These prepayments will be treated as <a href="real.htm">real</a> investments so those End-<a href="user.htm">User</a>s become <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
And the ROI for their risk is paid to them as at-<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t instead of trying to sell the outputs at the market with the hope of keeping <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> <small>(which requires scarcity)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not just Crowd <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ed, but Crowd *<a href="own.htm">OWN</a>ED* so each sub-venture can concentrate on <a href="use.htm">use</a>-value, since the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t will no longer need to be sold - the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t will be the direct ROI.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Communities can simply *buy* the infrastructure away from these corporations - since those communities eventually <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for all those <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s anyway *and* <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Community-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ed buses and/or cabs where the potential customers are also the sole <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers means the rides are not sold for exchange-value, but are already under the control of those who need those services as a result of their <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing those <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s early.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We must organize "Community <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ed Agriculture" <small>(COA)</small> where those that can prepay for their food will commit <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s to purchase the <a href="land.htm">Land</a>, Water rights, Tools, Seeds, etc. - and those that are in need of <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ment can prepay by committing their labor to that endeavor.<br/>
<br/>
A COA would not sell the results at the end of the season, but divides it among those <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers in accordance with the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> each had invested.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let's look at the most trivial case of a single person <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing a fruit tree for his <a href="own.htm">own</a> benefit.<br/>
<br/>
He must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, including Wages if he does not do the <a href="work.htm">work</a> himself.<br/>
<br/>
But he cannot <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> *more* than <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>, for who would he <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> it to?<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is defined as <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> but if he does not sell the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is undefined.<br/>
<br/>
So he <a href="fund.htm">Fund</a>ed that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and <a href="own.htm">Own</a>s those means for the expected return of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t instead of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was "<a href="use.htm">Use</a> Value" <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion instead of "Exchange Value".&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not benefit this <a href="own.htm">own</a>er when other orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a>s fail in the area unless he resorts to selling that which he would have eaten.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>..<br/>
<br/>
This is all very obvious and might seem unimportant, but let's push the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a a bit further and see what happens:<br/>
<br/>
<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine now, instead of a single <a href="fund.htm">Fund</a>er-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>er-<a href="user.htm">User</a>, we have thousands of such inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s pooling <a href="fund.htm">Fund</a>s toward an orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a>.<br/>
<br/>
By attracting potential <a href="user.htm">User</a>s to pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for the goods they predict they will need, we can <a href="use.htm">use</a> those <a href="fund.htm">Fund</a>s to buy the means necessary for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="user.htm">User</a>s and <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers will then be the very same set.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t will not be sold because the ROI for the Risk is <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t itself which they attain at <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>..<br/>
<br/>
This solves the '<a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ic' case where the number of <a href="user.htm">User</a>s matches exactly the output of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
But many of these consuming inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s will want to over-<a href="own.htm">own</a> by some percentage to guarantee they have enough <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t at the round of each <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
We must do something with that surplus or it will rot.<br/>
<br/>
We can sell those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts for <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> - as much as the market will bear - but to keep the organization <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by the <a href="user.htm">User</a>s of those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts, we must treat the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as an investment from the <a href="user.htm">User</a> who paid it so they also gain <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>...<br/>
<br/>
In the attached <a href="pic.htm">pic</a>ture "Capitalism.png" we see inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s in the upper-<a href="left.htm">left</a> corner <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and receiving <a href="title.htm">Title</a> to those Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
All <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s, including <a href="work.htm">Work</a>er wages, are initially paid from that pool of <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing.<br/>
<br/>
The Consumer <small>(in blue)</small> begins to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing for those <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s in his <small>(late)</small> quest to buy <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects.<br/>
<br/>
Over time, if the business is successful, the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s receive all they had initially put forward and then begin receiving the special value called <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The Consumer never gains any <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in his <a href="own.htm">own</a> Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es under this arrangement.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the attached <a href="pic.htm">pic</a>ture "Patched-Capitalism.png" we see again see inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s in the upper-<a href="left.htm">left</a> corner <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and receiving <a href="title.htm">Title</a> to those Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es, but this time the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s are *also* Consumers of the future <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are taking risk for the purpose of receiving at-<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t under their full control.<br/>
<br/>
After each round of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion, the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects are not sold <small>(except in cases of surplus)</small>, because they are already the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of those who will consume them.<br/>
<br/>
The heavy line indicates there is no transfer of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, but shows the <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ers are already the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers without any need to purchase since they paid all the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and are the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers as a side-effect of their <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom of the <a href="pic.htm">pic</a>ture shows a Consumer with insufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership buying <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects late and probably <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
But in this case, that overpayment is treated as an investment from the Consumer who paid it - causing him to unwittingly <a href="fund.htm">Fund</a> the purchase and care of even *more* Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es that will eventually begin <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing and therefore provide him with that which he needs.<br/>
<br/>
This allows the organization to grow and yet remain distributed as all <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is 'reflected' <a href="back.htm">back</a> to those willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for that growth.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Investment creates risk.<br/>
<br/>
Seeking <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> incents scarcity.<br/>
<br/>
When consumers <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects are not sold.<br/>
When <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects are not sold, <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> does not occur.<br/>
<br/>
There is no need to sell <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects when they are already the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of those who will <a href="use.htm">use</a> them.<br/>
<br/>
Overaccumulation is the result of treating <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as a reward for those who are already organized.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership can be automatically distributed to those willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for it by treating that overpayment as an investment from the consumer who paid it so they also gain <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in some Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
Growth must be 'reflected' <a href="back.htm">back</a> to those willing who <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for that growth.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> The <a href="user.htm">user</a>s themselves must have <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, and so must be the initial and <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>ally the only inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> The 'return' the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s will receive for this investment is at-<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> access to the outputs of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion - in this case, internet connectivity.<br/>
<br/>
3.)</small> For late-coming <a href="user.htm">user</a>s who want to buy any surplus <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t <small>(<a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> bandwidth, data <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age, CPU cycles)</small>, we should charge <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <small>(<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> for as much as "the market will bear".<br/>
<br/>
4.)</small> All <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> collected from non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers must be treated as that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er's investment in more physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es - so that each and every <a href="user.htm">user</a> incrementally becomes a <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>er in the material assets required to host that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When any <a href="user.htm">user</a> pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s <small>(whether as an up-front investment, or when<br/>
<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <small>(<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small>)</small>, they receive two items:<br/>
<br/>
A.)</small> A <a href="title.htm">title</a> of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership over those <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ed physical assets.<br/>
<br/>
B.)</small> A book of "Scheduling Tickets" or "Allocation Tokens" that the<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>er would <a href="use.htm">use</a> to prove <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of and therefore collect the<br/>
outputs of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine some agents are attempting to share the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es required for <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age.<br/>
<br/>
Whether they are attempting to <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>e bytes or bread doesn't <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e much <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence, in both cases the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t being <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>ed is subject to decay and destruction.<br/>
<br/>
One question I have is: Who, <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>ally, should be in control of those physical assets?&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>(I would say "who should <a href="own.htm">own</a>", but if I remember right, you are reluctant to <a href="use.htm">use</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in our quest to secure the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion?)</small><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another question comes as a result of accepting outsiders.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine they want to increase the size of the operation for even more benefits associated with <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy of scale.<br/>
<br/>
Should they charge <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> <small>(<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>)</small> against those latecomers?&nbsp;&nbsp;And if so, what should be done with that value?&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice, if you do not charge <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, then it is likely someone will 'scalp' the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t by buying a large a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> and then reselling it closer to what the "market will bear".<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is commonly <a href="use.htm">use</a>d as a return for inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s who took risk.<br/>
<br/>
It may seem there is nothing else we can do, for what else would inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s accept?<br/>
<br/>
There is a special case we seemed to have overlooked, where we can <a href="use.htm">use</a> <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t to reward those who are willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> early.<br/>
<br/>
This special case only applies to inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s who are simultaneously potential consumers of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t - and who invest only as much as it will take to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e what they, personally, will consume.<br/>
<br/>
So the answer is similar to "Crowd <a href="fund.htm">Fund</a>ed", but more like "Consumer <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ed" - where those <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ers are <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers in the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion for the sole purpose of thereby having <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the outputs of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion as a sort of "side effect".<br/>
<br/>
Notice the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is not sold <small>(for it is already the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of those who will <a href="use.htm">use</a> it)</small>. This causes <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> to be undefined - for the <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e of the finished <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is exactly the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s which were paid for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So the answer is to attract Customers to pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t - while using those pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ments as actual investments which are then <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ed by those Customers who benefit from the <a href="use.htm">use</a>-value of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, and never need strive for Scarcity, for the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t will usually never be sold.<br/>
<br/>
In the case where a Customer-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>er has too much <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t: the solution is to sell that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t to non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, and even to charge <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> <small>(<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>)</small> against those late comers *BUT* - here is the trick - the <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> received must be treated as though that Customer had just made an investment toward even more Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
Treating <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er's investment will allow the collective to include others while simultaneously avoiding the typical problems of overaccumulation and excessive concentration of control that cause even the most well-intentioned organizations to finally fail to meet the needs of those they were initially formed to serve <small>(the customers of course!)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But if we could organize to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> early - to collectively purchase the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts and services we need - then, we would still need to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
But since we would <a href="own.htm">own</a> the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ective as a side-effect of our <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es, we would no be 'buying' from ourselves, and so COULD NOT <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, for that final transaction would not even occur!<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is UNDEFINED when the Customers are the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers of the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The customers *already* <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
We, the consumers, foot the entire bill.<br/>
<br/>
And we *also* <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> because we choose to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> late.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between the <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e a consumer<br/>
<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s for a finshed good or service, and the <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s<br/>
in<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ed during <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you <a href="own.htm">own</a> an Apple tree, you do not *buy* the apples from yourself.<br/>
<br/>
If you and your neighbor <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> an Apple, you need not *buy* the apples from your collective 'self'.<br/>
<br/>
If you 999 other people <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> an Apple orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a>, you need not *buy* the apples from your collective 'self'.<br/>

1,)</small> Consumer Cooperatives *sell* the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t <a href="back.htm">back</a> to the <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers and collect a <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> during that transaction that a committee then doles out in a Tyranny of the Majority fashion.<br/>
<br/>
1a.)</small> <a href="imput.htm">Imput</a>ed <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion only sells <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t to non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, and only when there is surplus, and treats that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as an investment from that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er - causing <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership and control to be automatically distributed at the point of sale <a href="back.htm">back</a> to the actor who was willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;This system minimizes and nearly eliminates the <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ing of goods since the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es does not buy the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ective, but <a href="own.htm">own</a>s it already as a result of his <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ing of goods will tend toward zero but does not reach stasis because of <a href="new.htm">new</a>comers into the system <small>(even just babies being born)</small>, and because people's interests change across time.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> Consumer Cooperatives are "Democratically Controlled" with one-member/one-vote.<br/>
<br/>
2a.)</small> <a href="imput.htm">Imput</a>ed <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion is far more autarchic- where any member can 'fork' his portion of the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es and secede from the union or sell those shares if a split is attempted that is finer than reasonable divisibility <small>(you can't both feed a single milk-cow grain and NOT feed that cow grain, but can divide a herd)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
2b.)</small> Each member has exactly as much vote power as he has <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership. If you <a href="own.htm">own</a> 11% of a roto-tiller and your neighbor <a href="own.htm">own</a>s 22%, then you have only half as much vote power in decisions such as "how often should we change the oil".<br/>
<br/>
3.)</small> Every Consumer Cooperative I <a href="know.htm">know</a> of is only concerned with buying <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts that were made by Capitalists.<br/>
<br/>
3a.)</small> <a href="imput.htm">Imput</a>ed <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion is primarily about <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership and control of the entire tree of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion - recursively, and <a href="work.htm">work</a>s toward a Vertically Integrated Commons where we, the people, <a href="own.htm">own</a> the farms and factories and <a href="land.htm">land</a> and water rights and all the other <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es and supporting <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es required to re<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e those things.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<small>(*)</small>In cases where an agent has invested more than he can <a href="use.htm">use</a> directly, he can sell that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t to agents who do not yet have sufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, but under the strict condition <small>(enforced by a Terms of Operation over that organization)</small> that any <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> collected during that sale be treated as an investment from that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er - so the organization can grow in size while avoiding the troubles of centralization and overaccumulation that plague nearly every other endeavor that even begins to succeed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We can write a Terms-of-Operation that we can then apply to <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty Rights ... a sort of <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty <a href="left.htm">Left</a> if you will, that will allow us to <a href="use.htm">use</a> regular <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership as the basis of a <a href="new.htm">new</a> approach to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ing physical assets that we might more efficiently hold in common.<br/>
<br/>
I think of it as a "simulated commons" that is constructed somewhat <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificially - in that we do not wait for a government or corporation to finally do the "right thing", but instead <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e that action ourselves, in a collective manner.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="part.htm">Part</a> of the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>iculty comes in discovering what 'rules' or 'laws' must be included in the Terms-of-Operation.<br/>
<br/>
I believe I have found 2 of those rules:<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> Consumers are the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s who are the *<a href="real.htm">real</a>* <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers of those Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion and the 'return' is the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t itself which they *already <a href="own.htm">own</a>* as a side-effect of their <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts.&nbsp;&nbsp;This creates a truly <a href="use.htm">use</a>-value endeavor.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is treated as <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er Investment. This means late-comers <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>, but that overpayment is invested *for them* in even more Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion - so that each <a href="user.htm">User</a>s incrementally gains the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty they need to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> them from <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a negative-feed<a href="back.htm">back</a> loop.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> Organize <a href="user.htm">User</a>s to <a href="fund.htm">fund</a> and therefore <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> the physical layer for their <a href="own.htm">own</a> benefit.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will allow us to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> only <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s since <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is undefined when we do not buy the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t but <a href="own.htm">own</a> it *already* as a side-effect of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> When surplus <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t <small>(bandwidth or <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age in this case)</small> is sold to <a href="user.htm">User</a>s who have insufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, we should collect <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> from them*, but must treat that overpayment as <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er Investment - growing the <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> while simultaneously and continuously distributing the <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership of that <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> to those who are willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for it.<br/>
<br/>
<small>(*)</small> It may sound hypocritical to say we should collect <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> <small>(charge <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>)</small>, but if we do not, the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t will be resold for a <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> anyway, and yet will not be under our collective control, and so will not be able to apply the Negative-Feed<a href="back.htm">back</a> loop <small>(treating <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er investment)</small> needed to <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e every <a href="user.htm">User</a> gains the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership needed to help them STOP <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> - for the <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>er of Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s, but does not BUY the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t since he <a href="own.htm">own</a>s it already as a result of his <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<a href="real.htm">Real</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty to invest and hold some physical <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty for their <a href="own.htm">own</a> benefit.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Investment from <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect <a href="user.htm">User</a>s <small>(<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> or '<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>')</small> is high in the early stages of development, but approaches zero as each citizen <small>(consumer)</small> gains their <a href="own.htm">own</a> percentage of <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
One way to approach this is through a legally binding Social Contract that <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers could apply a to collective Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es so <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> would always be interpreted as <a href="user.htm">User</a> Investment whenever the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts were given, <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ed, shared, sold or <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ed.<br/>
<br/>
This inter-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er <a href="trad.htm">Trad</a>e <a href="agree.htm">Agree</a>ment should allow maximum divisibility so any <a href="user.htm">user</a> may opt-out or 'fork' their portion to treat it <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ly without needing the approval of all other <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, let's say you have gained <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in beef cattle because you paid <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>eAbov<a href="ecos.htm">eCos</a>t for hamburgers.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may vote <small>(weighted by your % of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership)</small> on how ALL those animals are treated as a group, but if you have some special goals that few other <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers would <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> on, you can also *DIVIDE* out a <a href="real.htm">real</a>istic portion&nbsp;&nbsp;from the whole if your <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is large enough to meet the minimum granularity.&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you want your animals to be fed grass instead of grain, the granularity would be at ''one animal'', since it is impossible to feed <a href="part.htm">part</a> of an animal one diet, and the other portion another...&nbsp;&nbsp;In another case, if you are only concerned about how the meat is <a href="pack.htm">pack</a>aged, then the granularity is much finer, and you should be able to meet those goals - though it would be your responsibility to organize that division and to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> any extra <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s <small>(such as wages)</small> required to do any extra <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Any group of <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers will dis<a href="agree.htm">agree</a> on policy over shared <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
Some types of 'contiguous' things, such as roads, sewer, water, electricity, gas lines, etc. need more logistic restrictions in their divisibility.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is an inverse measure of competition and a direct measure of monopoly.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the portion of <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e, <a href="rent.htm">Rent</a>, Tax or Interest that goes beyond <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;That <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> becomes usury unless it is treated as an investment from the consumer who paid it.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> should be interpreted as a plea for development because it measures consumer dependence.&nbsp;&nbsp;Usury gained against consumers disrespects their natural desire to grow, so hampers true progress.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> collected as a reward for the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers is s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>darily troublesome because it inverts the goals of that corporation from abundance and <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom toward scarcity and power.<br/>
<br/>
If your are alone on the is<a href="land.htm">land</a> and 20 more people suddenly arrive, how are 'we' going to decide how to collectively manage the available Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es?<br/>
<br/>
Collective <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership as a body - in-corp-oration is the original and only valid purpose of government.<br/>
<br/>
Citizens and consumers are the same, and should be the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers for maximum performance, <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom and peace.<br/>
<br/>
Whether you call it a church, a city, a club, commons, community, company, coop, corporation, county, cult... managing collective <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty is <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult.<br/>
<br/>
Business and government are separated now only because we understanding that most businesses, especially the larger ones are somehow not fully aligned with the goals of the rest of society.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the mistreatment of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> that inverts our original goals of peace and abundance.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers may accidentally squander their inheritance.&nbsp;&nbsp;1st-world nations are covered with barren and even poisonous plants and mostly worthless animals - no chickens in the yards and the bees are dying.<br/>
<br/>
Originating <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers hold no special <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>us; each consumer who <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s more than <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> becomes an inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a> in Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es to <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e their <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of future <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects.<br/>

<br/>
Their ROI for taking risk would be to avoid <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> - since the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of an Apple tree does not *buy* the Apples from himself, but <a href="own.htm">own</a>s those <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ectives already, as a side-effect of his <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>

<br/>
milk-dairy does not purchase the milk from the collective others, but <a href="own.htm">own</a>s it ALREADY - as a result of his <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ing the cattle.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn't buy the milk from the dairy, but the collective will need to track how much milk he has withdrawn so he is not able to cheat the other <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers out of their share of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
One way to achieve this tracking could be through the issuance of "Scheduling Tickets" or "Allocation Tokens" that each <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>er would receive after pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing for the next round of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
Each <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>er would have a <a href="title.htm">Title</a> of <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership proving their shares of <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty in the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <small>(such as the dairy)</small>, and they would also receive a booklet of tickets that they could tear-out and <a href="use.htm">use</a> to '<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>' for the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t that they already <a href="own.htm">own</a> <small>(they would not be buying the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, only proving that they are en<a href="title.htm">title</a>d to that a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a>)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
A nice thing about this technique is that the tickets could be <a href="pass.htm">pass</a>ed to others - <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing them more anonymous, and also allowing them to be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d as a crude sort of <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency.<br/>
<br/>
Another way to do this would be for the collective to keep a 'register' that records whether or not the <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>er has collected his share of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t for that round.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let's examine the "other side of the equation".<br/>
<br/>
Let's try to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> the <a href="work.htm">Work</a>er's need to Consume by helping them organize to have <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion from which they need the Outputs instead of trying to <a href="own.htm">own</a> the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion for which they happen to have <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s in operating.<br/>
<br/>
So, instead of <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers trying to <a href="own.htm">own</a> the factory where they <a href="work.htm">work</a>, they instead direct-invest* in things like Milk Dairies, Chicken Farms, Avocado Orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a>s, etc. because those are the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of the things they actually need, and let the potential Consumers of what they <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e <a href="own.htm">own</a> that factory.<br/>
<br/>
<small>(*)</small> By 'direct-invest' I mean the Consumers would invest to <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> the Fields, Farms etc. and be 'paid' <small>(their ROI)</small> in <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t instead of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> - for the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t would never be sold since it would already be the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of those who intend to actually <a href="use.htm">use</a> it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What I describe is a "short circuit" across the typical market.<br/>
<br/>
Where the consumers do not buy the finished goods, but <a href="own.htm">own</a> them already - even before they are completed - as a side-effect of their <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of those goods.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> Since the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is not sold, there is no chance for the government to collect sales tax.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> Since the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is not sold, there is no chance for the government to disallow that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <small>(buying raw milk is illegal in many <a href="part.htm">part</a>s of the US)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The customers *already* <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
We, the consumers, foot the entire bill.<br/>
And we *also* <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> because we choose to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> late.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But if we could organize to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> early - to collectively purchase the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts and services we need - then, we would still need to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
But since we would <a href="own.htm">own</a> the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ective as a side-effect of our <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es, we would no be 'buying' from ourselves, and so COULD NOT <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, for that final transaction would not even occur!<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is UNDEFINED when the Customers are the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers of the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
Why are we so disorganized and/or terrified of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership that we leave it up to those that intend to subjugate and dominate us?<br/>
<br/>
And instead of taking a stance through <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, we beg and plead with the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers to "please do the right thing" - even though the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers have NO POSSIBLE CHANCE of "doing the right thing" for they owe inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s who expect <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e be kept above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
And <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e can only be kept above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> during Scarcity.<br/>
<br/>
So we see the drive for Scarcity is caused by choosing inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s who expect <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as a return.<br/>
<br/>
The drive for Scarcity can be eliminated by choosing inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s who expect <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t as a return.<br/>
<br/>
But only Customers can <a href="use.htm">use</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t as a return.<br/>
<br/>
So the answer is to attract Customers to pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t - while using those pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ments as actual investments which are then <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ed by those Customers who benefit from the <a href="use.htm">use</a>-value of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, and never need strive for Scarcity, for the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t will usually never be sold.<br/>
<br/>
In the case where a Customer-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>er has too much <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t: the solution is to sell that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t to non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, and even to charge <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> <small>(<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>)</small> against those late comers *BUT* - here is the trick - the <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> received must be treated as though that Customer had just made an investment toward even more Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
Treating <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er's investment will allow the collective to include others while simultaneously avoiding the typical problems of overaccumulation and excessive concentration of control that cause even the most well-intentioned organizations to finally fail to meet the needs of those they were initially formed to serve <small>(the customers of course!)</small>.<br/>
