Some examples that already occur:<br/>
1.)</small> Some people joint-purchase an RV <small>(Motor Home)</small> so they can <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> only <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> People <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> vacation homes before the Time-Share industry organized to take that over for the purpose of charging more than <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
3.)</small> Co-purchasing an airplane allows the group of <a href="user.htm">user</a>s to share it amongst themselves - usually hiring a pilot to operate it and <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing those wages as a <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>, but <a href="real.htm">real</a>izing great savings since <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is not paid.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="co-own.htm">Co-own</a>ership allows us to invest in industry that would be out of reach for individual <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers because of financial constraints and the typical inability to fully utilize those Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
Capitalists already <a href="use.htm">use</a> the strength of <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership against us when the joint-invest in for-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> corporations.<br/>
<br/>
Without <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership we must do everything on our <a href="own.htm">own</a> or suffer <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> to those who do <a href="own.htm">own</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Capitalists will infiltrate any community we try to establish - just as they <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently do - when they buy the <a href="land.htm">land</a>, water rights, <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>s, restaurants, meeting places, grocery <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>es, shopping malls, farms, factories, etc. that are more efficiently <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by more than one person.<br/>
<br/>
Once they <a href="own.htm">own</a> that infrastructure, and if we are not "pushing against it" by organizing and <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ing for ourselves, then we will be overrun as usual.<br/>
<br/>
Single-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is important for Personal <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, but for as long as we continue to resist solving this problem of <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership will we be at the mercy of those that <a href="use.htm">use</a> it against us.<br/>

<span class="h2">== Example Studies</span><br/>
There is a special <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic case that occurs when the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er of some Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <small>(the material Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion)</small> are also the <a href="user.htm">User</a>s of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect<small>[ive]</small>s <small>(output, <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, purpose)</small> of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h4">==== Case 1: Single-<a href="user.htm">User</a>, Single-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>er</span><br/>
INDIVIDUAL <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er of Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <small>(say an apple tree and 'supporting' <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es such as <a href="land.htm">land</a>, water rights, tools)</small> is the ONLY <a href="user.htm">User</a> of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect<small>[ive]</small>s <small>(apples, shade, wood)</small>:<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> This base case is meant to show why <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect <a href="user.htm">User</a>s should be <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers.<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> The <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er of the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <small>(tree, etc.)</small> is also the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect<small>[ive]</small>s <small>(apples, etc.)</small> even before <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is complete.<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> The <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er has full control over the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect<small>[ive]</small>s because he is also the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er of the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er doesn't want dangerous chemicals <a href="spray.htm">spray</a>ed, there are no questions asked.<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Abundance for others is not a problem, as the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er seeks <a href="use.htm">use</a>-value <small>(consumption)</small>, not exchange-value <small>(<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small>.<br/>

<span class="bullet">*</span> Un<a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ment is not a problem, the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er wants all chores automated away.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="h4">==== Case 2: Multi-<a href="user.htm">User</a>, Multi-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>er</span><br/>
COLLECTIVE <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es are SOME of the <a href="user.htm">User</a>s of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect<small>[ives]</small>:<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> This most important case covers the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>iculties of <a href="co-own.htm">Co-Own</a>ership.<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> All points of Case 1 apply.<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> The <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers may charge Non-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ing <a href="user.htm">User</a>s a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This may cause the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers to seek scarcity of others <small>(destroy all competitors)</small> because reducing competition increases <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is balanced by treating <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as an investment from the <a href="user.htm">User</a> who paid it.<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ing <a href="user.htm">User</a>s do not have control.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is balanced by treating <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as an investment from the <a href="user.htm">User</a> who paid it.&nbsp;&nbsp;This causes every <a href="user.htm">User</a> to gain <a href="co-own.htm">Co-Own</a>ership in Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <small>(he now <a href="own.htm">own</a>s a tiny % in some new trees being planted for him and other non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ing <a href="user.htm">user</a>s that are <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability for <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers to collect <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> against this <a href="user.htm">User</a> in the future <small>(after his investment <a href="start.htm">start</a>s <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing)</small> is then reduced because that <a href="user.htm">User</a> will <a href="own.htm">own</a> as many "at-<a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects <small>(apples)</small> as his % of Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <small>(tiny slice of the apple orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a>)</small> <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>es.&nbsp;&nbsp;This may seem insignificant, but it adds up, and 'balances' the system.&nbsp;&nbsp;By understanding <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> to be a <a href="user.htm">User</a>'s investment, we see his 'investments' <small>(<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> tapers toward zero as he gains <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership in Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es because that <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership also automatically gives him <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership, and those <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects are a replacement <small>(competition)</small> for some of what the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers were selling.&nbsp;&nbsp;As this settles, competition approaches perfection and no <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects <small>(apples)</small> even need be sold because the Consumers that need them already <a href="own.htm">Own</a> them even before they are <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed because of their sufficient <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership in the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of those <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whew!<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er votes are weighted by their % of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in each indivisible Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e.<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Minor groups who lose a vote may split/fork/divide from the majority.&nbsp;&nbsp;If 80% of the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers want the orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> <a href="spray.htm">spray</a>ed, the remaining 20% can opt-out by <a href="part.htm">part</a>itioning off a <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion of the farm from those chemicals.<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Solutions to voting, granularity and divisibility can be very complicated, and this needs further discussion, but is not specific to <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect <a href="user.htm">User</a>s being <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers.<br/>

<span class="h2">== Conclusion</span><br/>
When this is running we will no longer need to "<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>-up" wages because <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers will push them higher through their ability to "hold out" when their consumption is <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ed when they have <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of their <a href="own.htm">own</a> needs.<br/>
<br/>
Investment from <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect <a href="user.htm">User</a>s <small>(<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> or '<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>')</small> is high in the early stages of development, but approaches zero as each citizen <small>(consumer)</small> gains their <a href="own.htm">own</a> percentage of <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
One way to approach this is through a legally binding Social Contract that <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers could apply a to collective Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es so <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> would always be interpreted as <a href="user.htm">User</a> Investment whenever the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts were given, <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ed, shared, sold or <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ed.<br/>
<br/>
This inter-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er <a href="trad.htm">Trad</a>e <a href="agree.htm">Agree</a>ment should allow maximum divisibility so any <a href="user.htm">user</a> may opt-out or 'fork' their portion to treat it <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ly without needing the approval of all other <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, let's say you have gained <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in beef cattle because you paid <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>eAbov<a href="ecos.htm">eCos</a>t for hamburgers.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may vote <small>(weighted by your % of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership)</small> on how ALL those animals are treated as a group, but if you have some special goals that few other <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers would <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> on, you can also *DIVIDE* out a <a href="real.htm">real</a>istic portion&nbsp;&nbsp;from the whole if your <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is large enough to meet the minimum granularity.&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you want your animals to be fed grass instead of grain, the granularity would be at ''one animal'', since it is impossible to feed <a href="part.htm">part</a> of an animal one diet, and the other portion another...&nbsp;&nbsp;In another case, if you are only concerned about how the meat is <a href="pack.htm">pack</a>aged, then the granularity is much finer, and you should be able to meet those goals - though it would be your responsibility to organize that division and to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> any extra <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s <small>(such as wages)</small> required to do any extra <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Any group of <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers will dis<a href="agree.htm">agree</a> on policy over shared <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
Some types of 'contiguous' things, such as roads, sewer, water, electricity, gas lines, etc. need more logistic restrictions in their divisibility.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is an inverse measure of competition and a direct measure of monopoly.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the portion of <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e, <a href="rent.htm">Rent</a>, Tax or Interest that goes beyond <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;That <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> becomes usury unless it is treated as an investment from the consumer who paid it.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> should be interpreted as a plea for development because it measures consumer dependence.&nbsp;&nbsp;Usury gained against consumers disrespects their natural desire to grow, so hampers true progress.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> collected as a reward for the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers is s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>darily troublesome because it inverts the goals of that corporation from abundance and <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom toward scarcity and power.<br/>
<br/>
If your are alone on the is<a href="land.htm">land</a> and 20 more people suddenly arrive, how are 'we' going to decide how to collectively manage the available Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es?<br/>
<br/>
Collective <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership as a body - in-corp-oration is the original and only valid purpose of government.<br/>
<br/>
Citizens and consumers are the same, and should be the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers for maximum performance, <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom and peace.<br/>
<br/>
Whether you call it a church, a city, a club, commons, community, company, coop, corporation, county, cult... managing collective <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty is <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult.<br/>
<br/>
Business and government are separated now only because we understanding that most businesses, especially the larger ones are somehow not fully aligned with the goals of the rest of society.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the mistreatment of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> that inverts our original goals of peace and abundance.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers may accidentally squander their inheritance.&nbsp;&nbsp;1st-world nations are covered with barren and even poisonous plants and mostly worthless animals - no chickens in the yards and the bees are dying.<br/>
<br/>
Originating <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers hold no special <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>us; each consumer who <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s more than <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> becomes an inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a> in Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es to <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e their <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of future <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects.<br/>

<a class="ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_estate">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_estate</a> A con<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent e<a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e or co-tenancy is a concept in <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty law, <a href="part.htm">part</a>icularly derived from the common law of <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, which describes the various ways in which <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty can be <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by more than one person at a given time.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="part.htm">part</a>ies who <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty jointly are referred to as co-tenants or joint tenants.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most common-law jurisdictions recognize three kinds of con<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent e<a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e: tenancy in common, joint tenancy with right of survivorship, and tenancy by the entirety.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many jurisdictions simply refer to a joint tenancy with right of survivorship as a joint tenancy, but a few U.S. <a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>es treat the phrase joint tenancy as synonymous with a tenancy in common.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h4">====Co-tenant</span><br/>
Co-tenants, irrespective of the type of tenancy, share certain rights relative to each other and to the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, except to the extent they have <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified these rights through an <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment among themselves:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 1. Each tenant has an unrestricted right of access to the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where one co-tenant wrongfully excludes another from <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing <a href="use.htm">use</a> of the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, the excluded co-tenant can bring a cause of action for ouster,', and may receive the fair <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>al value of the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty for the time that he was dispossessed.<br/>
&nbsp; 2. Each tenant has a right to an accounting of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s made from the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty generates income such as <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>, each tenant is en<a href="title.htm">title</a>d to a pro-rata share of that income.<br/>
&nbsp; 3. Each tenant has a right of contribution for the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.&nbsp;&nbsp;Co-tenants can be forced to contribute to the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment of expenses such as <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty taxes and mortgages on the entire <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
Co-tenants do not have any obligation to contribute to any <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of repairing or improving the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.&nbsp;&nbsp;If one co-tenant adds a feature that enhances the value of the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, that co-tenant has no right to demand that any others share the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of adding that feature - even if other co-tenants reap greater <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s from the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty because of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at <a href="part.htm">part</a>ition, a co-tenant is en<a href="title.htm">title</a>d to <a href="recover.htm">recover</a> the value added by his or her improvements of the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversely, if the co-tenant's "improvements" decrease the value of the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, the co-tenant is responsible for those decreases as well.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, each co-tenant can independently encumber the co-tenant's <a href="own.htm">own</a> share in the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty by taking out a mortgage on that share <small>(although this may effectively convert a joint tenancy to a tenancy in common, as described below)</small>; other co-tenants have no obligation to help <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> a mortgage that only runs to another tenant's share of the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, and the mortgagee can only foreclose on that mortgagor's share.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="bank.htm">Bank</a> loans secured by mortgages on individual shares of <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ed <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty is one of the most rapidly expanding areas in the mortgage lending industry.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, co-tenants owe one another a duty of fair dealing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, any co-tenant who acquires a mortgage claim against the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty must give his co-tenants a reasonable opportunity to purchase <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ortionate shares in that claim.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h4">====Tenancy in common</span><br/>
Tenancy in common is the default form of con<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent e<a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e, in which each <a href="own.htm">own</a>er, referred to as a tenant in common, is regarded by the law as each <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing separate and distinct shares which may <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>er in size.&nbsp;&nbsp;This form of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is common where the <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers are not married or have contributed <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a>s to the acquisition of the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, if joint <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers had attempted to <a href="use.htm">use</a> another form of joint <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership such as a joint tenancy with right of survivorship or a tenancy by the entirety, and the effort was for some reason invalid, the joint <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers would then be tenants in common.&nbsp;&nbsp;If conclusive evidence is not available of the desire to create a tenancy with rights of survivorship or a tenancy by the entirety, courts will determine that a tenancy in common has in fact been created.<br/>
<br/>
Tenants in common have no right of survivorship, meaning that if one <a href="own.htm">own</a>er dies, that <a href="own.htm">own</a>er's interest in the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty will <a href="pass.htm">pass</a> by inheritance to that <a href="own.htm">own</a>er's devisees or heirs, either by will, or by inte<a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e succession.<br/>
<br/>
Destruction of a tenancy in common<br/>
<br/>
Where any <a href="part.htm">part</a>y to a tenancy in common wishes to destroy the joint interest, he or she can do so through a <a href="part.htm">part</a>ition of the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty - a division of the <a href="land.htm">land</a> into distinctly <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed plots if such division is legally permitted based upon zoning and other local <a href="land.htm">land</a> <a href="use.htm">use</a> restrictions or, where such division is not permitted, a forced sale of the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty followed by a division of proceeds.<br/>
<br/>
If the <a href="part.htm">part</a>ies are unable to <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> to a <a href="part.htm">part</a>ition, any or all of them may seek the ruling of a court to determine how the <a href="land.htm">land</a> should be divided up, physically divide it between the joint <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers <small>(<a href="part.htm">part</a>ition in kind)</small>, leaving each with <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of a portion of the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty representing their share.&nbsp;&nbsp;Courts may also order a <a href="part.htm">part</a>ition by sale in which the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty is sold and the proceeds are distributed to the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where local law does not permit physical division, the court must order a <a href="part.htm">part</a>ition by sale.<br/>
<br/>
Each <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>er is en<a href="title.htm">title</a>d to <a href="part.htm">part</a>ition as a matter of right, meaning that the court will order a <a href="part.htm">part</a>ition at the request of any of the <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only exception to this general rule is where the <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers have <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>d, either expressly or impliedly, to waive the right of <a href="part.htm">part</a>ition.&nbsp;&nbsp;The right may be waived either permanently, for a specific period of time, or under certain conditions.<br/>
