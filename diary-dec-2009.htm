<br/>
Hmm.&nbsp;&nbsp;That's true for nearly all <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent corporations and the<br/>
governments they control.<br/>
<br/>
But then who is this group called "we" that they are against?&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it<br/>
not the end <a href="user.htm">user</a>s?<br/>
<br/>
And why are they against us?&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> requires scarcity,<br/>
and so seeking to perpetuate <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> incents <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity and<br/>
withholding solutions.<br/>
<br/>
We don't yet have "<a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom" in the physical <a href="real.htm">real</a>m because we<br/>
haven't yet discovered how to incorporate for our <a href="own.htm">own</a> purposes.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>..<br/>
<br/>
Here is my rough plan to solve this issue:<br/>
<br/>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;We, the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s, get together to <a href="fund.htm">fund</a> organizations and even<br/>
corporations that operate for our <a href="own.htm">own</a> benefit - where the 'return' for<br/>
those investments would be "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" goods and services which are<br/>
under *our* <small>(limited to the <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers of those physical re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es)</small><br/>
full control.<br/>
<br/>
This is good and sufficient for the '<a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ic' case - where the number<br/>
of initial inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s is equal to the number of <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="user.htm">user</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
But if an organization is to grow, it must become 'dynamic' - and must<br/>
consider the case of the 'new' <a href="user.htm">user</a> that has not yet paid for his<br/>
share of physical <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership required for the "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" access the<br/>
others enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
This lack of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership causes the new <a href="user.htm">user</a> to be at a disadvantage.<br/>
He is at the mercy of the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers who will most likely charge<br/>
him a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <small>(they will collect <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
The organization cannot grow unless more than <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s are paid, since<br/>
"at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" access only covers <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent operational expenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;So the<br/>
collection of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is somewhat beneficial, for there could be no<br/>
growth without it, but that value is usually 'mistreated' as a reward<br/>
for those <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers instead of being considered an investment<br/>
from the <a href="user.htm">user</a> who paid it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even so-called "non-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>" corporations<br/>
keep this value while pretending it is not <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as they pad their<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a> wages, or they re-invest it into the organization but just like<br/>
the for-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s, those new investments become the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of the<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span><a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent* <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers instead of becoming the <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of the person<br/>
who paid it.<br/>
<br/>
2. The 'fix' for the dynamic case is to write a sort of Contract or<br/>
Terms of Operation very similar in purpose to the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> but enforced<br/>
by <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty rights instead of copyright.&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary <small>(and as far as I<br/>
can tell maybe even the only)</small> constraint of this contract is that all<br/>
<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <small>(all <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> be invested in more physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es<br/>
needed for the growth of that entity, but those new investments are<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by the <a href="user.htm">user</a> who paid that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>

<br/>
Of course they want you to buy meat instead of buying cattle.&nbsp;&nbsp;Meat is an output of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, whereas cattle are the <small>(primary)</small> physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> goes missing when the consumers <a href="own.htm">own</a> the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.&nbsp;&nbsp;But <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers don't want to be paid wage alone, they want to be <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers so consumers <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s AND also <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Sharing meat is far weaker than sharing cattle!&nbsp;&nbsp;We must buy and <a href="own.htm">own</a> the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, not just the outputs of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion or there is no <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence from raw Capitalism at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;Boring.<br/>

<br/>
<a href="user own.htm">User Own</a>ed theory describes <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e Above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> = <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e - <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a><br/>
<br/>
But <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is confusingly often equated with the word Value as though it should be a goal of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between Consumer <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e and <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s - where Wages are one of those <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;It describes a consumer's dependence on those <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is not needed by society.&nbsp;&nbsp;It only appears to be needed for development because we ignorantly leave <a href="fund.htm">Fund</a>ing to a group of inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s that expect to be paid from that pool.<br/>
<br/>
But if consumers would group together to buy the material Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion with <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t being their reward instead <small>(you could think of it as a pre <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment plan where they become full legal <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers)</small>, then we would finally be in full control and would also receive those goods and services at a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e equal to <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> since <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is undefined when the end <a href="user.htm">user</a>s have sufficient* <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is an inverse measure of consumer development and can be balanced <small>(to solidify an <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy)</small> by treating it as an investment from the consumer who paid it toward more Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es needed for future <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion as outlined in the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public law.htm">General Public Law</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<small>(*)</small> "Sufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership" means the consumer <a href="own.htm">own</a>s enough of <small>(for example)</small> Cow-Shares that purchasing milk is not needed - for they would <a href="own.htm">own</a> the milk as a 'side effect' of their <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the cattle.&nbsp;&nbsp;In that case the consumer must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for the daily operations of the dairy, but does not buy milk from anyone since it is already their <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
All consumers lacking "Sufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership" would need to buy milk, and at that point they would be subject to the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers possibly charging a <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e Above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
A <a href="user own.htm">User Own</a>ed dairy would allow <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers to sell any extra milk they may have to new consumers with the Terms of Operation enforced stipulation that all <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e Above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> be treated as that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er's investment in more cattle and supporting <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es <small>(barns, water rights, tools, feed, etc.)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The investment would become <small>(after a vesting period)</small> the <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of that new consumer so that, incrementally and in a self-correcting manner, the organization would continue to be <a href="user own.htm">User Own</a>ed even as it grows to cover the earth with the abundance that those adhe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>s would have no reason to fight against.<br/>

A Cow-Share program is an example of Demand Side investment into the material Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion for the purpose of receiving at-<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> dairy <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts under full consumer control.<br/>
<br/>
This <a href="user own.htm">User Own</a>ed form of organization was made illegal in Utah, U.S. with the <a href="pass.htm">pass</a>age of HB311 by Margaret Dayton Utah <a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>e Senator, District 15.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Text of the bill can be read at: <a class="ext" href="http://www.le.state.ut.us/~2007/htmdoc/hbillhtm/HB0311.htm">http://www.le.state.ut.us/~2007/htmdoc/hbillhtm/HB0311.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
It is easy to see why the Corporate-run governments <a href="pass.htm">pass</a> such laws:&nbsp;&nbsp;The largest problem Cow-Sharing causes for 'regular' <small>(for-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> organizations is the ability for the end-<a href="user.htm">user</a> to receive the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t without ever <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the consumers <a href="own.htm">own</a> the cattle, barn, tools, etc. - they would <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> only the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <small>(including wages)</small>, but <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is undefined.&nbsp;&nbsp;This <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el undercuts all other <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership arrangements because the goal is finally for <a href="use.htm">Use</a> value alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;For-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> corporations probably claim some sort of "unfair competition" since their only purpose for existence is to keep <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e Above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>

See <a class="ext" href="http://SenateSite.com/blog/2007/02/raw-milk-regulations.html">http://SenateSite.com/blog/2007/02/raw-milk-regulations.html</a> for <small>(lack of)</small> justifications.<br/>

<br/>
Robert Verzola's entry mentions "demand side" <small>(as compared to "supply side")</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking about these terms just the other day I noticed the negative connotations of 'demand' while 'supply' seems incontrovertibly positive ... even *saving*.&nbsp;&nbsp;Promoting a <a href="payer own.htm">Payer Own</a>ed society will require better terminology.</p>
