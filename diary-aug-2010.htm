<span class="quot">> If a <a href="work.htm">work</a>er cannot accumulate what they earn,</span><br/>
<br/>
Nobody can 'earn' <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>!<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> only occurs when Consumers lack <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Consider this scenario:<br/>
<br/>
Let's say I'm good at jack-hammering, but am sick and tired of my boss being paid more than it <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s him to supply the tools and to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> my wage.<br/>
<br/>
After many years of saving I finally have enough to buy my <a href="own.htm">own</a> jack-hammer.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I quit my <a href="job.htm">job</a> as a wage-slave and advertise my services as an entrepreneur.<br/>
<br/>
Soon I have many clients and things are going quite well.<br/>
<br/>
One day a wealthy so-and-so suddenly decides he is going to open a tool-<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>al business with a strange goal: The terms of operation for this business is to "Break even, but do not charge enough to <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>."<br/>
<br/>
So now everyone in the area is able to <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> jack-hammers and <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> exactly the same a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> it <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s me in oil, repairs, extra <a href="part.htm">part</a>s, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Now whenever someone needs such <a href="work.htm">work</a> done, I can only charge the <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s plus Wages - where Wages are determined on the "open market".<br/>
<br/>
This, by definition, means I will no longer be able to collect <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> because competition in that field is now under perfect competition.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, competition reduces <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> and perfect competition *eliminates* <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The reason for this is that before the tools were available to the Consumers "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>", I was able to keep other <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers from competing against me because the barrier-to-entry was the initial expense of the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <small>(the jack-hammer)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
This shows that <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> has nothing to do with <a href="work.htm">Work</a>, but is only a result of Consumers lacking at-<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> access to the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion - and where the *ultimate* guarantee of at-<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> access is through <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>

I guess by 'technically' you mean 'not'.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, but these Co-operatives are not doing what i describe.<br/>
<br/>
Consider a small group that <a href="own.htm">own</a>s a small dairy.<br/>
<br/>
You'll need to keep the sizes small during this mental exercise because we have been programmed to believe larger groups *MUST* be governed in a representative manner even though that is not true.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine the number of members just 2 people if you must.<br/>
<br/>
Now, when the milk is taken from the cattle and <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>ed in the refrigerator, *who* is the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t?<br/>
<br/>
Will each of the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers be required to *buy* the milk from the collective as a whole, or will they just split it up according to how much <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership they each have in the dairy?<br/>
<br/>
If there were just two people, will they each be required to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> into some strange pool that they will then <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> themselves again?<br/>
<br/>
Does this change at 3 people?&nbsp;&nbsp;4, 5, 10, 20, 100, 1000?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>s are re-distributed to members</span><br/>
<br/>
That is what those cooperatives are ignorantly doing, but that is not what I am describing.<br/>
<br/>
This is a result of a poor arrangement where the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers have to buy the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t <a href="back.htm">back</a> from themselves!&nbsp;&nbsp;What a bunch of fools!<br/>
<br/>
Those extra transactions are also targets for the containing governments to punish them with sales tax and open them to scrutiny as to whether they should be allowed to sell something as dangerous as raw milk, whereas what I describe side-steps these issues altogether.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> Consumer Co-ops are the solutions to your</span><br/>

<br/>
Er, no.<br/>
<br/>
Cooperatives are definitely not what we need to move forward to a world of <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom and diversity.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> can safely and fully eliminated when the consumers are *<a href="real.htm">real</a>* <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers in the means of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, and not until then.<br/>

<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between Consumer <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e and <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s. Why pretend it is anything else?<br/>

We are addicted to the notion that all these things must be purchased instead of <a href="real.htm">real</a>izing we could <a href="own.htm">own</a> them as a "side effect" of having <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion AS A CONSUMER.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if you <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> <a href="part.htm">part</a> of a dairy, then you do not need to *buy* your portion of the milk from the collective others - you <a href="own.htm">own</a> it already as a result of your having <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
This is a great way to side-step the Gestapo trying to stop us from <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ing locally: simply stop <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ing <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts and <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e only services instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;But in order to do so, the Consumers must invest and <a href="own.htm">own</a> the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of that which they need with the ROI being at-<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.<br/>

<br/>
This will be resolved when the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers <a href="own.htm">own</a> the means of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion for that which they CONSUME, for then they will not need to beg for <a href="work.htm">work</a> nor will they need to remain on the side of the Capitalists who seek scarcity in their drive to keep <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>es above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s.<br/>

I've been trying to loosen my views lately in the direction you describe, but I see some big problems with being so inexact.<br/>
<br/>
There are many psychological troubles here - where the <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>est <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers are rewarded no more than the lazy, and so are taught each round to <a href="work.htm">work</a> less and less.<br/>
<br/>
But maybe even more important is the issue of who <a href="own.htm">own</a>s the outputs.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is *undefined* when Consumers <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es directly <small>(this is not how Consumer Cooperatives <a href="work.htm">work</a>.

<br/>
We need to short-circuit the exchange of the final goods because the corporate-run governments will continue to increase the number and variety of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts they claim citizens are not allowed to sell to one another.<br/>
<br/>
Direct Consumer <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership in the manner I envision side-steps this bullshit by eliminating the exchange of goods altogether - for the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of a Apple tree does not *buy* Apples, but <a href="own.htm">own</a>s them already as a side-effect of his <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
Please let me <a href="know.htm">know</a> if what I describe does or doesn't <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e sense.<br/>

If the "Terms of Incorporation" says <a href="part.htm">part</a> of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> must be treated as the <a href="work.htm">Work</a>er's investment, then they will gain <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership alongside the Consumer.<br/>
<br/>
Since I don't see this as a major threat to the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a as a whole, I am going to try to assimilate it into the <a href="new.htm">new</a> form so I can get this business going.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> I remember you had no concrete interest in</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> implementing it, only to talk and argue about it,</span><br/>
<br/>
Well, I didn't have any <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y <a href="back.htm">back</a> then, and was still trying to iron out the bugs, so couldn't yet go forward with implementation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> and to convince people 'by reason', that</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> your system is the best ever</span><br/>
<br/>
Sorry that is what you see.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Kevin has a similar view according to his "Rosetta Stone" comments in the past...<br/>
<br/>
I don't care *who* is right.<br/>
All I care is *what* is right.<br/>
<br/>
And the reason I care is because we need to get this figured out so we can incorporate in a <a href="new.htm">new</a> way that will <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> us from the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent system.<br/>
<br/>
I kept asking why the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers need <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership because I didn't understand why they needed it.<br/>
<br/>
Even now I still don't understand, but I think it is best to concede that point <a href="part.htm">part</a>ially so I can attract others to invest with me since it is such a hot psychological issue.<br/>
<br/>
One problem I will have when changing the "Terms of Operation" is to <a href="know.htm">know</a> how much the <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers should receive compared to those who <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> at the point-of-sale.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> I favour the sovereignty of the creators of value,</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> that's all, it's an a priori preference, and I accept,</span><br/>
<br/>
I also want those who add value to be sovereign.<br/>
<br/>
And for those who do not add value <small>(<a href="bank.htm">bank</a>ers and bums)</small> to have little or no say.<br/>
<br/>
I see that sovereignty coming through <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Means of what those <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers consume.<br/>
<br/>
But will try to understand and merge the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>as of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers needing extra <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in everything they operate so we can get this <a href="part.htm">part</a>y <a href="start.htm">start</a>ed.<br/>

<span class="quot">> if the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er is not a consumer, what then?</span><br/>
<br/>
The <a href="work.htm">work</a>er is guaranteed to be the consumer of *something*, for no human can exist unless they consume the outputs of other organisms.<br/>
<br/>
So every <a href="work.htm">work</a>er needs <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in that which he consumes.<br/>
<br/>
And every non-<a href="work.htm">work</a>ing 'dependent' also needs <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in that which he consumes.<br/>
<br/>
This <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>s each human from <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> and also gives him full dominion over that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
Even more astounding, when a <a href="work.htm">work</a>er <small>(human)</small> has sufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of that which he consumes, then the 'problems' of abundance and automation disappear.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no longer a reason to throttle <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion or destroy <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t or be afraid of innovation.<br/>
<br/>
So it is true that <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers <small>(humans)</small> need <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, but it is for the purpose of consuming, not for the purpose of <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing.&nbsp;&nbsp;We don't *need* <a href="work.htm">work</a>, we only *need* to consume.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the problem in understanding this concept is that we must consider all industries at once.<br/>
<br/>
Within the context of <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers having sufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of those things which the *consume*, what reasons are there for <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers to have *extra* <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es simply because they possess <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s needed to operate those <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es?<br/>
<br/>
Disconnecting <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership from the <a href="work.htm">Work</a> allows humans to easily choose and change occupations without being bound to one course because of heavy financial investment.<br/>
<br/>
It is also more likely for us to escape the claws of the <a href="bank.htm">bank</a>ers since the number of humans that consume any <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is almost always much larger than the number of <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers needed in that pursuit.<br/>
<br/>
Let's say I like to milk cows but am allergic to milk.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't need any <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the dairy to successfully <a href="work.htm">work</a> there.&nbsp;&nbsp;What good would it do me?<br/>
<br/>
So I may not be able to consume cow-milk, but we <a href="know.htm">know</a> I must consume *something*.<br/>
<br/>
If I like Almond-milk, I need some <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in a Almond orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> and the equipment needed to create that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t even if I never <a href="work.htm">work</a> there.<br/>
<br/>
My <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> will <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> me from <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> and will also give me full dominion over what goes into my body.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers in the Almond orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> and those who <a href="shell.htm">shell</a> and grind/press the nuts into milk need only as much <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in those <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es as they have interest in consuming that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership in the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es is vital for Consumers, but is only a liability for <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
The only value I see in <a href="work.htm">Work</a>er <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership is the coercive power it gives them to stop other potential <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers from doing that <a href="work.htm">work</a> for a lower wage or to force those Consumers to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> more than <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s in other ways.<br/>

They say these Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <small>(the phone <a href="boot.htm">boot</a>h)</small> has such low maintenance that there will be no need to hire anyone to do any <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
But the initial connection of the <a href="boot.htm">boot</a>h to the phone company's lines must certainly have been done by a <a href="work.htm">work</a>er.<br/>
<br/>
And it seems likely there will be a time in the future when some <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the phone must be serviced where none of the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s has the expertise to do so.<br/>
<br/>
And even if a <a href="user.htm">user</a> can be found with those <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s, why should he not receive some 'extra' <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership for his exertion even if he doesn't receive a Wage?<br/>
<br/>
So, in defense of the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion cannot be fair unless <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers have at least <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership, shouldn't those <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers gain some <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in that phone <a href="boot.htm">boot</a>h?<br/>

Subject: Authority, Representation and Secession in a P2P <a href="net.htm">Net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a><br/>
<br/>
Can the concepts of authority and representation be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d within a <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> that claims to be Peer2Peer?<br/>
<br/>
Is it <a href="real.htm">real</a>istic to give *everyone* 'root' access to a shared re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e?<br/>
<br/>
Is it <a href="real.htm">real</a>istic to give *everyone* the <a href="key.htm">key</a>s to our community center?<br/>
<br/>
There seems to be a need for gate-keeping - especially when <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ing ourselves from 'outsiders' that are not yet trusted.<br/>
<br/>
But even within a trusted circle, is there a level of scale when representation *must* come into play?<br/>
<br/>
This seems a valid question considering the failure of <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent 'authorities' and 'representatives' to achieve the goals of those they supposedly serve.<br/>
<br/>
But it also seems <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult to answer given the chaos that might ensue if there were no 'levels' of access to ... I'm not sure yet what needs to be constrained...<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if <a href="part.htm">part</a> of it may be the need to "slow down" the deliberation of change so we can discover what all other <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers want in each case.<br/>
<br/>
But does such deliberation require 'representation' and levels of 'authority', or could it be done in some other way?<br/>
<br/>
If giving everyone 'root' access is wrong, maybe giving any one person 'root' access is also wrong?<br/>
<br/>
Is that why we tend toward *groups* of representatives?<br/>
<br/>
But even in that case we fail to achieve <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom because those committees almost invariably <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e decisions and enact policy that suffers from the problem of "Tyranny of the Majority" because there is not an easy way for individuals and minority sub-groups to secede from the majority without loosing all of their investments.<br/>
<br/>
It is said these minorities have the "Right to Leave", but that is not sufficient because they then relinquish all the value they have added.<br/>
<br/>
I think <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the solution lies in discovering a way for these non-majority groups to 'split' or 'fork' those physical re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es during such conflicts.&nbsp;&nbsp;But that pre-supposes they had <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership to begin with - which is usually not the case, so <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership may be a pre-condition to sharing physical re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es in a P2P manner.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Notice even things you may not think of as 'physical' - such as a wiki - <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly *are* because of the equipment needed to 'host' that activity.<br/>

I've been <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing the last few days on a completely <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> approach to my goals that may eliminate many of these appa<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> problems, but for now will try to explain what I mean within the <small>(loaded)</small> terms I chose for the text you are examining.<br/>

Are you saying I cannot <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> a Dentist to fix my teeth?<br/>
<br/>
I <a href="know.htm">know</a> wage-slavery is a big problem now, but how will I attract <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>ed <a href="art.htm">art</a>isans to help me if I am not allowed to reward them in some way?<br/>
<br/>
Do you suppose they will do that <a href="work.htm">work</a> because they 'like' me?&nbsp;&nbsp;What if they do not like me?&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I get my teeth fixed if the only Dentist in the community dislikes me - even for no reason at all?<br/>
<br/>
Psychology sometimes plays tricks on people and they are biased against someone for no reason - such as - what if I remind the Dentist of someone they disliked in their past and for that reason they dislike me without consciously understanding why?<br/>
<br/>
What is the <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>osed manner of sharing <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>ed *labor* in the case that compensation is disallowed?<br/>

How can I offer a service such as "clean the bathroom" in exchange for someone else helping me to fix my teeth?<br/>

My reasoning here is that subleasing is not necessary since that person can <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> the item directly instead.<br/>

The deep reasoning for <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es accessible to the non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ing <a href="user.htm">user</a> is to help that latecomer gain control over their destiny instead of being perpetually dependent upon those that are already established through <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>

<br/>
I don't think there is a problem because i view these transactions in the more <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional sense of <a href="own.htm">own</a>er vs. non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er in an arrangement more similar to typical '<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>al' or 'lease' arrangements.<br/>
<br/>
It seems un<a href="real.htm">real</a>istic to me that everything is shared without limit and without accounting of who will be using it during that time.<br/>
<br/>
If the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of a re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e do not want someone to be able to exclusively occupy all 5 floors of a shareful house, then they can simply withhold such excessive offers and instead only offer 1 floor for <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>.<br/>
