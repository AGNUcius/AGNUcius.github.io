<hr/><span class="date">May-19-2011:</span> The collection of Taxes against <a href="land.htm">Land</a> Value<br/>
<br/>
I understand and 'believe' in the theoretical concept of taxing the<br/>
excessive holding of finite re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es such as <a href="land.htm">land</a>, water-rights,<br/>
mineral deposits, radio spectrum, etc.<br/>
<br/>
But exactly how to implement such a weight against those who intend to<br/>
harm the rest of humanity is not clear to me.<br/>
<br/>
Some Georgists/Geoists claim we only need to tax the <a href="land.htm">land</a><a href="own.htm">own</a>ers who<br/>
<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> to others.<br/>
<br/>
The piece at <a class="ext" href="http://WealthAndWant.com/HG/why_the_landowner_cannot_shift.html">http://WealthAndWant.com/HG/why_the_landowner_cannot_shift.html</a><br/>
defends this approach, and says it could only be the <a href="land.htm">land</a><a href="own.htm">own</a>er who<br/>
ultimately <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s that tax...<br/>
<br/>
But what would happen in the case where *ALL* citizens had sufficient<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership and nobody was <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ing from anyone else?<br/>

Of course no business cannot operate at a loss indefinitely.<br/>

We will have another advantage in that we will be able to operate<br/>
at "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" indefinitely - since we will not be trying to<br/>

My hope was to have Colin answer "Because corporations control governments".<br/>

A conusmer cooperative is very <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> from what I <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ose in a few<br/>

This means the cooperative actually charges <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> <small>(<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>)</small><br/>
against those Consumer/<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers, and then tries to get rid of that<br/>

<br/>
The <a href="user own.htm">User Own</a>ership <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el I <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ose is more like what would happen in<br/>

For example, <a href="imag.htm">imag</a>ine you and your neighbor run a <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> wire between<br/>

purchasing the equipment and the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of the labor to <a href="install.htm">install</a> it, and<br/>
the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of supplying the electricity, but you would not and COULD<br/>
not <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> because you are not each buying the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t <a href="back.htm">back</a> from<br/>
the collective two of you -- that would be nonsense, though that is<br/>
exactly what we will face if we give control to a municipality, and<br/>

<span class="quot">> So the people who give more surplus</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> control more of the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t?</span><br/>
<br/>
No, the people who have surplus do not *give*<br/>
it to anyone, they *sell* it to those who do not<br/>
yet have enough.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="pay.htm">PAY</a>ER is the one causing the collective<br/>
to grow, and is also the one who receives<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of that new growth.<br/>
<br/>
I'll give an example which might help clarify:<br/>
<br/>
Let's say Mr. A is an established member of the<br/>
collective, and has <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in a little bit more<br/>
Olive trees than he can <a href="use.htm">use</a> for himself.<br/>
<br/>
If he sells any of that fruit or even the oil, he is<br/>
required <small>(according to the Terms of Operation of<br/>
the collective)</small> to treat any <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> <small>(any<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>)</small> as <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er investment.<br/>
<br/>
Since he doesn't want to deal with trying to sell<br/>
the Olives directly, he just registers them at the<br/>
<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>ehouse, where all <a href="user.htm">user</a>s come to buy that<br/>
which they need, or to collect what is theirs<br/>
according to the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership they have.<br/>
<br/>
Now, Ms. B comes along as a visitor to the area.<br/>
<br/>
She has no <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in Olive trees, she just wants<br/>
some spaghetti that happens to include olives.<br/>
<br/>
She buys the meal from the collective and <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s<br/>
<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> <small>(<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>)</small>, a total of $5.<br/>
<br/>
She doesn't do this for charitable reasons, she does<br/>
this because this is how Capitalism always treats<br/>
here - the market always charges more than <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> -<br/>
for that is the purported *purpose* of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion!<br/>
<br/>
She is given a receipt that shows the $3 she paid<br/>
covers the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of delivering that meal, while the<br/>
extra $2 are to be treated as her investment - and<br/>
which will vest to her as <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership at some<br/>
time in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> What would happened if "<a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>ers" just chose to sell...?</span><br/>
<br/>
Well, that means they would not be gaining<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the growth of the collective, and so<br/>
would remain at the mercy of <small>(dependent upon)</small> those<br/>
who *do* have <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>

<span class="quot">> to acquire milk from a cow, how would it <a href="work.htm">work</a>?</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> What is each step?</span><br/>
<br/>
Roughly:<br/>
<br/>
A group of potential consumers pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for raw milk.<br/>
<br/>
Those <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s are <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to buy the cattle and equipment<br/>
and to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er wages - though it is even more<br/>
effective if some of the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s are qualified and willing<br/>
to do the <a href="work.htm">work</a>, for then we do not have to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> income<br/>
taxes.<br/>
<br/>
The consumer-inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s do not buy the milk <a href="back.htm">back</a> from<br/>
the collective others, but <a href="own.htm">own</a> it already - as a result<br/>
of their <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership in the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
This means we do not have to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> sales tax, because<br/>
the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is not being sold.<br/>
<br/>
Later, as the collective grows in size and efficiency,<br/>
some of the members may have surplus milk they cannot<br/>
<a href="use.htm">use</a> for themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;They can do anything with this milk<br/>
that they want *except*: if they sell the milk,they must<br/>
treat <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as though it were an Investment from the<br/>

the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <small>(including any Wages)</small>,<br/>

<span class="quot">> community as a reinvestment?</span><br/>
<br/>
This is something that is not yet perfectly clear to me.<br/>
<br/>
I think the <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> needs to be collected by the Seller<br/>
<small>(or by the community if he is leaving it in the<br/>
<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>ehouse to be sold for him...)</small>, and I think the Seller<br/>

for some a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of time or until some conditions are met,<br/>
but I don't <a href="know.htm">know</a> what they are.<br/>
<br/>
What I mean is: <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> must be invested in the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of<br/>
the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t from which it was derived <small>(for example, if we<br/>
were to sell a hamburger to a non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er, the <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> would<br/>
be invested in Beef cattle, Tomato plants, Wheat fields,<br/>
Chickens <small>(for mayo)</small>, spice plants, salt mines, and all the<br/>
<a href="land.htm">land</a> and water rights needed to support that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
But I don't think we can immediately vest that <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership<br/>
to the <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er, because I am worried most <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>ers will choose<br/>
to just sell those shares and thereby relinquish control<br/>
they would otherwise gain for their future benefit...<br/>
<br/>
Then again, maybe disallowing immediate vestment is being<br/>
too invasive and "nanny-<a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e".&nbsp;&nbsp;What are your thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> What would this organization do?</span><br/>

is to <a href="start.htm">start</a> a hotel/restaurant/grocery that would look<br/>
mostly normal from the outside, but would have a strange<br/>
kind of receipt that itemized the <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er's contribution -<br/>
showing what % was <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to cover the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of that<br/>
purchase, and also showing the estimated <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> which<br/>
would appear as a tiny share of <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership in the new<br/>
<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es that will be purchased and <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>t using those<br/>
<a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s, and which will eventually vest to that <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er.<br/>

<span class="quot">> "In February the food minister estimated that close to 15% of all grains and</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> vegetables in the country are wasted through "extravagant and luxurious</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> social functions", such as lavish wedding banquets."</span><br/>
<br/>
This is great for an <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy that treats <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as a reward for the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers because those bodies require there be a scarcity of the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t they intend to sell - for their only purpose for existence is to keep <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
This is so obvious and understood and long-standing that governments routinely *<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>* the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of agricultural <a href="land.htm">land</a> to *NOT* grow for the sole purpose of reducing the supply of that <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t.&nbsp;&nbsp;Look into the "Corn Laws" <small>[ <a class="ext" href="http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_Laws">http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_Laws</a> ]</small> for more on this.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When the Consumers <a href="own.htm">own</a> the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion, they have no incentive to reduce the overall supply because, since the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t is already the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of those who need it, it will not even be sold. The final transaction is eliminated in this case!<br/>
<br/>
The selling of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts can be thought of as a mis-allocation of <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es since, once a Consumer has sufficient <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership in the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion, he will have sufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in all the potential Output of those <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es as a side-effect of his <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if you <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> an Avocado tree, you must help cover all the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s <small>(including <a href="work.htm">work</a>)</small> needed to <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e that <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e is cared for, and that the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t <small>(Avocados)</small> are harvested on time, and that they are <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>ed and/or processed to preserve their value.<br/>
<br/>
But you do not *buy* the Avocados <a href="back.htm">back</a> from the other <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers because you <a href="own.htm">own</a> your percentage already.&nbsp;&nbsp;This also means you also cannot <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, for who would you <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> it to?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That solves the '<a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ic' case where each Consumer has exactly as much <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es as he wants <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
But I believe many such Consumers will want to <a href="own.htm">own</a> slightly more <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e than they need <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> against seasons where output is low because of weather or whatever.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a literal <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance.<br/>
<br/>
This surplus can be sold to other Consumers who do not yet have sufficient <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership, and we should even collect all the <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> that the market will bear during that transaction, but we must also do a very strange thing with that <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>; we must treat it as an Investment from the Consumer who paid it.<br/>
<br/>
Treating <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er Investment will allow these kinds of groups to scale in size and efficiency while avoiding the typical problem of overaccumulation and centralization of control that plagues nearly every other organizational form.<br/>

Yes, this is why we must treat <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er investment, so latecomers will gain their <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership along with the rest of us.<br/>

<br/>
We don't need to "turn a <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>" in a <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional sense, but we will actually need to collect <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> <small>(for whatever the market will bear)</small> from those overpaying latecomers - for if we don't, someone will just buy everything at-<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> and then resell it for a <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> without treating it in the special manner <small>(as <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er Investment)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Treating <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er Investment will allow each group to grow while auto-distributing the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership to those willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for that growth.<br/>

<hr/><span class="date">May-02-2011:</span> <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom <a href="hard.htm">Hard</a>ware -- <a class="ext" href="http://SocialSufficiencyCoalition.BlogSpot.com/2011/05/freedom-hardware.html">SocialSufficiencyCoalition.BlogSpot.com/2011/05/freedom-hardware.html</a><br/>
I wonder why we, as <a href="user.htm">user</a>s, refuse to accept the mantle of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
We don't need yet another layer; we need to collapse the role of Customer and Vendor into one, cohesive unit so the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers and <a href="user.htm">User</a>s no longer fight, but are one and the same.<br/>
<br/>
This can be done in new businesses we <a href="start.htm">start</a> by choosing potential Consumers AS the Inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s. This is similar to crowd-<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>ing or crowd-<a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ed, but is actually Crowd-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ed.<br/>
<br/>
When the Crowd <small>(the <a href="user.htm">User</a>s, Consumers, Customers)</small> choose to <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion this delimma will disappear.<br/>
<br/>
But there is one more issue: we must also <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> the late-comer who does not yet have enough <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership and is subject to the whims of those who are already established. If we do not solve this problem, then the business will move more and more toward the typical <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el of centralized control.<br/>
<br/>
The solution for the dynamic case is to write a Terms of Operation that we, as <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ing <a href="user.htm">User</a>s can choose to apply to our Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es in the same way software developers choose to apply the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> to their <a href="virt.htm">Virt</a>ual <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
This Terms of Operation will <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e that all <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> gathered from late-comers will be invested on behalf of that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er and must become that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er's co-<a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <small>(after some vesting period or after some conditions are met that are not yet clear to me)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
By doing this - by treating <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er investment - the <a href="user.htm">User</a>-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ed collective can grow in size while avoiding the usual problem of power concentration that occurs when <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is treated as the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of those who are already established <small>(the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers usually treat it as their <a href="own.htm">own</a> reward)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
G<a href="mail.htm">mail</a>, Facebook, Amazon, etc. hold our data and do things we do not want them to do, but we are mostly defenseless because - even though <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom Software exists to replace those services, there is not yet a fully <a href="real.htm">real</a>ized vision of <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom <a href="hard.htm">Hard</a>ware.<br/>
<br/>
When I say <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom <a href="hard.htm">Hard</a>ware, I am not talking about the design of <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ware, but am talking about <a href="real.htm">real</a>, physical instances of material assets such as <a href="land.htm">land</a>, water, <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>dings, <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ters, wires, and all the energy needed to power any of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
We, the <a href="user.htm">User</a>s need to gather together to <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> the Material Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <small>(the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es)</small> required to *host* the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion for which we need the outputs.<br/>
<br/>
We, the Customers can <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> the Datacenters, the Hotels, the Farms, the Factories. We already <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of those establishments anyway, and we also <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> because of our lack of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership!<br/>

Once we <a href="real.htm">real</a>ize <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership can be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d for our <a href="own.htm">own</a> good, we can stop using it against ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
But this will also require us to r<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>sider our errant view of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> so this new form of organization can grow without yet again consolidating power into the hands of those originators.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between the <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e a Consumer <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s, and all the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers paid <small>(including Wages)</small> for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
But when the Consumers truly <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion, their reward will be the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t itself, and there will be no need to sell any commodities except in the case where late-comers do not yet have sufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
In that case, where surplus is sold, we should still collect <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> from those <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ers, but we must then treat that special value as a Negative-Feed<a href="back.htm">back</a> loop by investing it for that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er - with the <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership finally vesting to that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er as his new assets.<br/>
<br/>
Doing this will cause late-comers to slowly grow the collective in exactly the manner in which they *prove* it needed to grow.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if someone paid $5 for a hamburger that only <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> us $2.75 <small>(including all wages)</small> to deliver, then we would invest $2.25 toward purchasing or raising more cattle, tomatoes, eggs <small>(for mayonaise)</small>, herbs, salt-mines, etc. and all the <a href="land.htm">land</a> and water-rights needed to <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion continues.<br/>
<br/>
As we grow in this way we will begin to be able to ignore the corporations that we <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently support, and in doing so we will regain political control at the most local level.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually the City, <a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>e, Nation and World governments will be reduced to their true purpose of our meeting for our collective reasoning of how to <a href="gui.htm">gui</a>de the planet.<br/>

<br/>
Many people believe if you can't program, there is no reason to have access to the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e Code because you would not be able to understand how to <a href="use.htm">use</a> it anyway.<br/>
<br/>
In an <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic sense, allowing <a href="user.htm">User</a>s access to the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es is absolutely *crucial* because of how this allows them to hire anyone with those <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s to <a href="work.htm">work</a> on, or fix or improve those <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
When <a href="user.htm">User</a>s are allowed at-<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> access to the <a href="virt.htm">Virt</a>ual <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <small>(such as <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code)</small>, competition between potential <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers is maximized because nobody can stop those <a href="user.htm">user</a>s from hiring anyone they like to create the solutions they want.<br/>
<br/>
This creates a strange situation where wages drop to nearly and often even completely to zero!<br/>
<br/>
This is also true of Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <small>(such as <a href="land.htm">land</a>, manufacturing plants, <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>dings, tools, etc.)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
For example, when a group of <a href="pass.htm">pass</a>engers decide to buy and <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> a car or bus or plane or ship, they must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s, including any wages for <a href="work.htm">work</a> they don't do themselves, but when one of those <a href="pass.htm">pass</a>engers <a href="know.htm">know</a>s how to operate those <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es, he will likely do it for <a href="free.htm">free</a> if he wants to arrive at the same destination <small>(if he is scratching his <a href="own.htm">own</a> itch)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
But it is not just wages that fall. When <a href="user.htm">User</a>s <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion, again - they must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s, but since they are treating the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t itself as the return for that investment <small>(the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is not even sold)</small>, they do not and even cannot <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>, for who would they <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> it to?<br/>
