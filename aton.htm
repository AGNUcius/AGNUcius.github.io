Akhn<a href="aton.htm">aton</a>'s Longer Hymn to the <a href="aton.htm">Aton</a><br/>
<br/>
Thy dawning is beautiful in the horizon of heaven,<br/>
O <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>ing <a href="aton.htm">Aton</a>, Beginning of life!<br/>
When Thou risest in the eastern horizon of heaven,<br/>
Thou fillest every <a href="land.htm">land</a> with Thy beauty;<br/>
For Thou <a href="art.htm">art</a> beautiful, great, glittering, high over the earth;<br/>
Thy rays, they encom<a href="pass.htm">pass</a> the <a href="land.htm">land</a>s, even all Thou hast made.<br/>
Thou <a href="art.htm">art</a> Ra, and Thou hast carried them all away captive;<br/>
Thou bindest them by Thy love.<br/>
Though Thou <a href="art.htm">art</a> from afar, Thy rays are on earth;<br/>
Though Thou <a href="art.htm">art</a> on high, Thy footprints are the day.<br/>
<br/>
When Thou settest in the western horizon of heaven,<br/>
The world is in darkness like the dead.<br/>
Men sleep in their chambers,<br/>
Their heads are wrapped up,<br/>
Their nostrils stopped, and none seeth the other.<br/>
Stolen are all their things that are under their heads,<br/>
While they <a href="know.htm">know</a> it not.<br/>
Every lion comes forth from his den,<br/>
All serpents, they sting.<br/>
Darkness reigns,<br/>
The world is in silence:<br/>
He that made them has gone to rest in His horizon.<br/>
<br/>
Bright is the earth, when Thou risest in the horizon,<br/>
When Thou shinest as <a href="aton.htm">Aton</a> by day.<br/>
The darkness is banished<br/>
When Thou sendest forth Thy rays;<br/>
The two <a href="land.htm">land</a>s <small>[of Egypt]</small> are in daily festivity,<br/>
Awake and standing upon their feet,<br/>
For Thou hast raised them up.<br/>
Their limbs bathed, they take their clothing,<br/>
Their arms uplifted in adoration to Thy dawning,<br/>
Then in all the world they do their <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
All cattle rest upon the herbage,<br/>
All trees and plants flourish;<br/>
The birds flutter in in their marshes,<br/>
Their wings flutter in adoration to Thee.<br/>
All the sheep dance upon their feet,<br/>
All winged things fly,<br/>
They <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>e when Thou hast shone upon them.<br/>
<br/>
The barques sail up-stream and down-stream alike.<br/>
Every highway is open because Thou has dawned.<br/>
The fish in the river leap up before Thee,<br/>
And thy rays are in the midst of the great sea.<br/>
<br/>
Thou <a href="art.htm">art</a> He who creates the man-child in woman,<br/>
Who <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>est seed in man,<br/>
Who giveth life to the son in the body of his mother,<br/>
Who sootheth him that he may not weep,<br/>
A nurse <small>[even]</small> in the womb.<br/>
Who giveth breath to animate every ojne that He <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>eth.<br/>
When he comes forth from the body . . .<br/>
On the day of his birth,<br/>
Thou openist his mouth in <a href="speech.htm">speech</a>,<br/>
Thou suppliest his necessities.<br/>
<br/>
When the chicken crieth in the egg-<a href="shell.htm">shell</a>,<br/>
Thou givest him breath therein, to preserve him alive;<br/>
When Thou hast perfected him<br/>
That he may pierce the egg,<br/>
He cometh forth from the egg.<br/>
To chirp with all his might;<br/>
He runneth about upon his two feet,<br/>
When he hath come forth therefrom.<br/>
<br/>
How manifold are all Thy <a href="work.htm">work</a>s!<br/>
They are hidden before us,<br/>
O Thou sole God, whose powers no other possesseth.<br/>
Thou dids't create the earth according to Thy desire,<br/>
While Thou wast alone:<br/>
Men, all cattle large and small,<br/>
All that are upon the earth,<br/>
That go about upon their feet;<br/>
All that are on high,<br/>
That fly with their wings.<br/>
The countries of Syria and Nubia<br/>
The <a href="land.htm">land</a> of Egypt;<br/>
Thou settest every man in his place<br/>
Thou suppliest their necessities.<br/>
Every one has his possessions,<br/>
And his days are reckoned.<br/>
Their tongues are divers in <a href="speech.htm">speech</a>,<br/>
Their form likewise and their skins,<br/>
For Thou, divider, hast divided the peoples.<br/>
<br/>
Thou <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>est the Nile in the <a href="net.htm">Net</a>her world,<br/>
Thou bringest it at Thy desire, to preserve the people alive.<br/>
O Lord of them all, when feebleness is in them,<br/>
O Lord of every house, who risest for them,<br/>
O sun of day, the fear of every distant <a href="land.htm">land</a>,<br/>
Thou <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>est <small>[also]</small> their life.<br/>
Thou hast set a Nile in heaven,<br/>
That it may fall for them,<br/>
<a href="mak.htm">Mak</a>ing floods upon the <a href="mount.htm">mount</a>ains, like the great sea,<br/>
And watering their fields among their towns.<br/>
<br/>
How excellent are Thy designs, O Lord of eternity!<br/>
The Nile in heaven is for the strangers,<br/>
And for the cattle of every <a href="land.htm">land</a> that go upon their feet;<br/>
But the Nile, it cometh from the <a href="net.htm">net</a>her woorld for Egypt.<br/>
Thus Thy rays nourish every garden;<br/>
When Thou risest they <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>e, and grow by Thee.<br/>
<br/>
Thou <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>est the seasons, in oprder to create all Thy <a href="work.htm">work</a>s;<br/>
Winter bringeth them coolness,<br/>
And the heat <small>[the summer bringeth]</small>.<br/>
Thou hast made the distant heaven in order to rise therein,<br/>
In order to behold all that Thou didst <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e,<br/>
While Thou wast alone,<br/>
Rising in Thy form as <a href="liv.htm">Liv</a>ing <a href="aton.htm">Aton</a>,<br/>
Dawning, shining far off, and returning.<br/>
<br/>
Thou <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>est the beauty of form through Thyself alone,<br/>
Cities, towns, and settlements,<br/>
On highway or on river,<br/>
All eyes see Thee before then,<br/>
For Thou <a href="art.htm">art</a> <a href="aton.htm">Aton</a> <small>[Lord]</small> of the day over the earth.<br/>
<br/>
Thou <a href="art.htm">art</a> in my heart;<br/>
There is no other that <a href="know.htm">know</a>eth Thee,<br/>
Save Thy son Akhn<a href="aton.htm">aton</a>.<br/>
Thou hast made him wise in Thy designs<br/>
And in Thy might.<br/>
The world is in Thy hand,<br/>
Even as Thou hast made them.<br/>
When Thou hast risen they <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>e;<br/>
When Thou settest they die.<br/>
For Thou <a href="art.htm">art</a> duration, beyond mere limbs;<br/>
By Thee man <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>eth,<br/>
And their eyes look upon Thy beauty<br/>
Until Thou settest.<br/>
All labour is laid aside<br/>
When Thou settest in the west.<br/>
When Thou risest they are made to grow. . . .<br/>
Since Thou didst establish the earth,<br/>
Thou hast raised them up for Thy son,<br/>
Who <a href="cam.htm">cam</a>e forth from Thy limbs,<br/>
The King, <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>ing in truth, . . .<br/>
Akhn<a href="aton.htm">aton</a>, whose life is long;<br/>
<small>[And for]</small> the great royal wife, his beloved,<br/>
Mistress of the Two <a href="land.htm">Land</a>s, . . . Nefertiti,<br/>
<a href="liv.htm">Liv</a>ing and flourishing for ever and ever.<br/>
