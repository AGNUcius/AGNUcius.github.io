<br/>
Yes, this is because <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is slowly but continuously concentrated<br/>
into the hands of the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
That <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership is concentrated because <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> <small>(<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>)</small> is<br/>
treated as a *reward* for those <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, further increasing<br/>
their holdings.<br/>
<br/>
The solution to this problem is: the organization must treat all<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> <small>(<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>)</small> as though it were an *investment* from the<br/>
consumer who paid it.<br/>
<br/>
To reiterate: Control can be continuously auto-distributed to those<br/>
who are willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for it by treating <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er investment.<br/>
<br/>
Handling <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as an investment from the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er is a negative-feed<a href="back.htm">back</a><br/>

<br/>
Yes, that is why I <a href="use.htm">use</a>d the term "Zero *MARGINAL* <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>" just as those<br/>
who talk about the "abundance of digital re<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion".<br/>
<br/>
In other words, the "abundance of *organic* re<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion" is no <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a><br/>
in terms of <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s to our planet and as to the labor required.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to point out, as I think you are, there is no such thing as<br/>
"Immaterial <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion", no matter which sphere is being considered.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now I expect someone will say<br/>
&nbsp;"Of course there are <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s, nobody is denying that!".<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But terms like "Zero Marginal <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>" and "Immaterial <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion" and<br/>
even "<a href="free.htm">Free</a>" confuse the conversation and lead many to believe the<br/>
implied claim is that those <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s are simply not important.<br/>
<br/>
Another very common theme in these discussions is that the<br/>
<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omics of this <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is now very <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> from the<br/>
past - as though the underlying <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>e of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion and <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership<br/>
of the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion is no longer an issue.<br/>
<br/>
This mixes-in with the dreamy visions of self-replicating robots that<br/>
will save us from ourselves, even though organisms <small>(<a href="use.htm">use</a>d to be)</small><br/>

Hello "Feeding America",<br/>
<br/>
I wonder, if instead of simply purchasing finished <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts from mega<br/>
corporations, why not organize all this value and effort toward <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing<br/>
some farms for ourselves?<br/>
<br/>
When we <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> massive corporations such as ConAgra and, indirectly,<br/>
Monsanto to supply us with that which we need, we are sending the<br/>
signal that they should continue on their vicious warpath of lowering<br/>
the biodiversity of the planet.<br/>
<br/>
Have you watched <a class="ext" href="http://FoodInc.org">http://FoodInc.org</a> ?<br/>
<br/>
Since Feeding America is such a large organization, let's switch gears<br/>
and get more vertically integrated into <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
Let's <a href="use.htm">use</a> some of the <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s gathered each year to begin buying the<br/>
Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of food <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion such as the <a href="land.htm">Land</a>, Water rights,<br/>
Tools, Trees, Seeds, Animals, etc. needed to gain some <a href="real.htm">real</a> control<br/>
for our <a href="own.htm">own</a>, mutual benefit.<br/>
<br/>
This will also drastically lower the <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e we must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> to this food -<br/>
since we then will have those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts at <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> and no longer be <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Is there any reason Feeding America should not move in this direction?<br/>
<br/>
We should be growing Trees full of Olives, Avocados, Almonds, Pecans, Walnuts.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For our <a href="land.htm">land</a> to flow with Milk and Honey,<br/>
We will need to <a href="own.htm">own</a> the Cattle and Bees.<br/>

<br/>
For example, say a group of customers of raw-milk pool their $ and/or<br/>

When each consumer/<a href="own.htm">own</a>er arrives at the dairy to get milk, they do not<br/>

My <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>as complement and extend yours in these ways:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Allow you to target businesses and governments that are interested in the <a href="land.htm">land</a>scaping and an appearance of goodness <small>(helping the needy)</small>, but otherwise have no <a href="use.htm">use</a> of those outputs.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Help <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e a more continued <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ment through Service Contracts.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Help you and your business avoid government interference and lower your tax liability by receiving a portion of your income as the outputs themselves which you would then <a href="use.htm">use</a> directly.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a form of <a href="imput.htm">Imput</a>ed <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion that <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es you appear less wealthy than you <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly are - since there are then no numbers to report.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h3">===Target Markets</span><br/>
Businesses should not be overlooked, as they have large budgets and are always looking for a way to improve the <small>(mostly false)</small> notion that they care about something besides themselves.<br/>
<br/>
You can take advantage of those Public Relations <small>(PR)</small> <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s by helping to expose their contribution to the Greater-Good when they allow you to <a href="use.htm">use</a> their <a href="land.htm">land</a> and water to help Feed the Hungry through Local <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
This similarly applies to mid and high income households that would like to appear more 'green' to their neighbors, but do not have the time or will to deal with those 'manufacturing' plants themselves.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here is the approach in rough form:<br/>
A.)</small> We will <a href="install.htm">install</a> beautiful yet <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive plants for approximately the same <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e as non-<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive plants.<br/>
<br/>
B.)</small> We will optionally contract with you to tend those plants and harvest the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts in perpetutity at NO <a href="cost.htm">COST</a> to you except we will retain some % of that harvest as <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment.<br/>
<br/>
C.)</small> We will optionally process and <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>e your % at NO <a href="cost.htm">COST</a> to you except we will retain some further % of that harvest as <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment.<br/>
<br/>
D.)</small> We will optionally prepare your % into advanced solutions, even fully prepared meals at NO <a href="cost.htm">COST</a> to you except we will retain some % further of that harvest as <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h3">===Vertical Integration</span><br/>
As you gain more of these <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t-as-<a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>ment Service Contracts, you will finally have more output than you or your <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ees can <a href="use.htm">use</a> directly.<br/>
<br/>
At that point, you can begin using these raw materials as the inputs of other businesses such as creating Olive-oil, Almond-milk, Nut-based nutrition bars, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Later, you can even open restaurants supplied by those outputs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h3">===Business Orientation</span><br/>
Because of the nature of your endeavor, a carefully written "Mission <a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>ement" will qualify you as non-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
This would have NO EFFECT on the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y you or your <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers can keep as reward, it only requires you call those rewards *Wages* instead of *<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>* - it is a simple matter of book-keeping.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h3">===General <a href="ide.htm">Ide</a>as</span><br/>
For trees, concentrate on high-oil <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts such as Avacado, Olive, Nut - as they are much more valuable <small>(both nutritionally and <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>tarily)</small> than fruit.<br/>
<br/>
For small plants, don't forget spices and herbs, which are usually easy to grow, yet very expensive at the market.<br/>
<br/>
Off-the-shelf dog houses might be a simple basis for small Chicken shelters.<br/>
<br/>
Don't forget Bee Hives - informing potential customers of <a class="ext" href="http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_collapse_disorder">http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_collapse_disorder</a> to increase their moral imperative.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h3">===Advertising and Online Presence</span><br/>
Don't spend any <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y on a <a href="web.htm">web</a>site unless you are sure you cannot meet your needs for <a href="free.htm">free</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<a class="ext" href="http://BlogSpot.com">BlogSpot.com</a> and <a class="ext" href="http://Blogger.com">Blogger.com</a> are likely sufficient for your blogging needs, and are <a href="free.htm">free</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<a class="ext" href="http://GooglePages.com">GooglePages.com</a> can be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d if you need more control over the page layout.<br/>
<br/>
<a class="ext" href="http://LinkedIn.com">LinkedIn.com</a> is also <a href="free.htm">free</a> and will add to your credibility.<br/>
<br/>
You might be able to advertise online for <a href="free.htm">free</a> if you qualify as a non-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h3">===Minor Details</span><br/>
The name is fun, but the word "Garden" may do more harm than good, as it conjures the all-too-familiar <a href="pic.htm">pic</a>ture of labor-intense, messy, and mostly un<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive plots that must be hidden from view.<br/>
