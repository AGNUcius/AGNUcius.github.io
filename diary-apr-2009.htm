<hr/><span class="date">Apr-30-2009:</span> <a class="ext" href="http://Answers.com/topic/labor-theory-of-value">Answers.com/topic/labor-theory-of-value</a> says<br/>
<span class="quot">"'The labour theory of value was fully developed by classical <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omists, especially David Ricardo and Marx. Ricardo argued that the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e <small>(strictly, the exchange-value)</small> of a good was in <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>al conditions determined by the quantity of labour that had gone into <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing it <small>(including <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing the capital goods that helped to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e it)</small>. Marx argued that this was the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er deserved to get <small>(thus <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing an unspoken connection with Locke before him and, paradoxically, with Nozick after him)</small>. However, the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er actually tended to get only enough wages to keep him at <a href="work.htm">work</a> and capable of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing children. The <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between the two was the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er's surplus value. Under capitalism, surplus value was unjustly ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riated by capitalists; under socialism it would belong to the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers, as in the classically Marxist formula of Clause IV: 4 of the Labour <a href="part.htm">Part</a>y constitution <small>(1918-95)</small>, which defined its <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ective as being "to secure for the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers . . . the full fruits of their industry".<br/>
<br/>
The labour theory of value takes no account of the role of demand in setting <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es. Two labourers may burn up the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>ntical number of calories in breaking up <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>ntical volumes of ore that they have mined on the common. But if one yields iron and the other silver, they will not fetch the same <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e.<br/>

<hr/><span class="date">Apr-30-2009:</span> Posted as an explanation for my subscription to <a class="ext" href="http://Groups.Google.com/group/ofcs">Groups.Google.com/group/ofcs</a>:<br/>
<span class="quot">"'I am <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing on an alternate <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>e of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion, it's accompanying <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency and a detailed plan of implementation within our <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent system.<br/>
<br/>
The high-level goal is to help Consumers <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion required for the Goods and Services they need.<br/>
<br/>
This is, of course, in striking contrast to the <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional approach which assumes the <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers must organize and <a href="own.htm">own</a> the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <small>(<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
This distinction is not arbitrary, and the effects are profound.<br/>
<br/>
When the Consumer of any <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect <small>(let's say an apple)</small> happens also to be the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er of the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <small>(apple tree, <a href="land.htm">land</a>, water-rights, tools for pruning and harvesting, etc.)</small> of that <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect, then he must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> Wages to anyone he might hire, but he does not <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, for who would he <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> it to?&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is appa<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ly undefined in this special case.<br/>
<br/>
But if we want to guarantee such an arrangement continues - so that ALL future consumers who arrive late can also gain the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership they need to control their destiny - then we must treat any <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> that <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers might charge against those future Consumers <small>(who do not yet have enough <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership to '<a href="protect.htm">protect</a>' themselves from being charged <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>)</small> - we must treat that <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> as an investment from the Consumer who paid toward even *MORE* <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion so they <small>(the <a href="new.htm">new</a>, late-arriving Consumers)</small> also <a href="work.htm">work</a> their way toward <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency <small>(I call <a href="gnurho.htm">GNUrho</a>)</small> is not quite solidified, but is <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently based on the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a that the receipt given to the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing customer is actually a <a href="title.htm">Title</a> or Deed of <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership signifying the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es that will be purchased in his name, and the vesting date of that investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can also think of this <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership as 'shares' or '<a href="stock.htm">stock</a>', but not in the usual, Capitalistic manner, for the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er never receives any <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> paid by anyone else, but instead receives the "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts <small>(<a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects)</small> of that investment as his return.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, let's say you purchase a hamburger from such an organization for $5 but the total actual <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s for delivery <small>(including all wages)</small> is only $3.50.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, the organization will charge you the full $5, and the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <small>(the <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>)</small> will be re-invested into growing that business, but the big <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence is that YOU are the <small>(not-yet-vested)</small> <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er of that little bit of <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers will <a href="use.htm">use</a> your $1.50 investment <small>(your <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>)</small> along with the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ments of many other customers to purchase more beef cattle, wheat seed, tomato plants, onion bulbs, etc. plus <a href="land.htm">Land</a> and Water Rights needed to 'host' those organisms.<br/>
<br/>
So the business will grow almost "as usual" and yet the typical problem of Capital Accumulation does not occur because the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is automatically 'distributed' <small>(it's not that the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership actively distributed, but that the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is NOT concentrated into the hands of the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers)</small>.<br/>
'"</span><br/>
<br/>
<hr/><span class="date">Apr-27-2009:</span> Coercive Taxation can be replaced by Optional <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e Investments made by any group of citizens <small>(consumers)</small> wanting that 'public' good or service.&nbsp;&nbsp;This <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>es control of that <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e to the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ers and solves the "Tyranny of the Majority" problem through a sort of "pre-emptive secession" made available as the default stance to simply not <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>.<br/>
<br/>
We must continue to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> 'external' taxes to the various levels of government we are growing withing <small>(at the level of city, county, <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e, federal, world)</small> until we can overgrow them or become parallel entities, but Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es wholly <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ed by it's inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s can approach <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing for "public utilities" within that organization in whatever manner that group sees fit.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, when we can organize a few thousand people to buy the <a href="land.htm">land</a> an capital to <a href="start.htm">start</a> a small city outside the borders of any other city, then those <small>(and only those)</small> <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers can set the policy for <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing public utilities within their jurisdiction.&nbsp;&nbsp;A city cannot <small>(legally)</small> refuse to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> County or Federal taxes, but has full dominion as to how City taxes are to be paid and applied.<br/>
<br/>
This is a fairly obvious <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ement.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course the joint <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of any <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <small>(for instance, a vacation house)</small> will have arbitrary rules and regulations regarding it's <a href="use.htm">use</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is sometimes <small>(maybe often)</small> overlooked is how this pattern is the same as that of any so-called governmental body.<br/>
<br/>
So <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers operating <span class="quot">"'within the context of jointly held private <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty'"</span> have a certain a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of sovereignty that at the very least allows them to *ADD* rules about how that <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty is treated.&nbsp;&nbsp;They can't *<a href="delet.htm">DELET</a>E* rules enforced by any of the containing governments because that is considered "breaking the law".<br/>
<br/>
But adding rules <small>(think of rules as private laws)</small> is actually all we need to begin - for what is missing from our organizational efforts are the constraints needed to thwart 'unfair' accumulation.<br/>
<br/>
Determining what is 'fair' is a big problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;And even if that can be decided, what will we do about it?<br/>
<br/>
Many have claimed the root of problem lies in <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers being underpaid.&nbsp;&nbsp;If only we could get the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers to be the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, it is said, then they could collect both wages AND <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> - and therefore would be compensated fully for their labor.<br/>
<br/>
This approach is based on the Labor Theory of Value which says <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is the result of <small>(occurs because)</small> the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er puts more value into the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of that good or service than he is paid in wages.<br/>
<br/>
The LTV doesn't say anything about why a consumer would be willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> that <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The consumer is <a href="left.htm">left</a> out of the discussion as though he has no impact on the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
But that approach seems myopic or even downright misleading since <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e is set at the point-of-sale as a transaction between a salesperson <small>(another <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ee separate from the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion laborer)</small> and the end consumer.<br/>

<span class="quot2">>> The ISPs, including incumbent telephone and cable companies, compete on an</span><br/>

<br/>
If the customers are <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing $11/month the ISPs are taking a <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>,<br/>
then it *could* be even cheaper.<br/>
<br/>
Right?<br/>
<br/>
I mean, if the WE <small>(any group with any need)</small> knew how to share, then<br/>
the WE could pool their re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es to lease the line and then share the<br/>
benefits at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Right?<br/>
<br/>
And if the WE were even more aggressive, the WE could even purchase<br/>
and *<a href="own.htm">own</a>* the Material Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <small>(the physical <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> in<br/>
this case)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Now the ./ <a href="art.htm">art</a>icle seems to imply that the WE <small>(in Sweden)</small> <a href="own.htm">own</a> those lines.<br/>
<br/>
But that is not quite true because the supposed WE <small>(the city in this<br/>
case)</small> will not lease the line directly to customers, but instead<br/>
require for-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> corporations become the "middle-men" - taking<br/>
control and value <small>(<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> away from the customers.<br/>
<br/>
There are more <a href="admin.htm">admin</a>istrative <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s if THEY <small>(the city government)</small> were<br/>
also the ISP layer.<br/>
<br/>
And the semi-valid argument against such a move is that it creates<br/>
centralized <a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>e Socialism.<br/>
<br/>
The reason that argument has some validity is because almost all<br/>
governments are <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently under the direction of Capitalist <small>(<a href="profit.htm">profit</a><br/>
maximizing and therefore scarcity maximizing)</small> corporations.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">.</span>...<br/>
<br/>
So we won't be able Govern ourselves effectively until we have control<br/>
of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
But we can't control <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <small>(can't organize effectively)</small> until we<br/>
discover how to share the Material Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
And sharing Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es for the purpose of maximizing <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom and<br/>
<small>(s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>darily)</small> utilization means we must <a href="know.htm">know</a> how to self-Govern.<br/>
<br/>
So it seems we may be at an im<a href="pass.htm">pass</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We can't change our <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent governments directly <small>(voting is theater)</small><br/>
because they are controlled by Capitalist Corporations.<br/>
<br/>
And we can't change how we create *<a href="new.htm">new</a>* Corporations because we do not<br/>
yet <a href="know.htm">know</a> precisely what is wrong with the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent entities.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, sure they're 'evil'.&nbsp;&nbsp;But what causes them to be such bullies?<br/>
<br/>
Is there any chance it is a structure that rewards scarcity?<br/>
<br/>
If so, then where is the root of that reward?<br/>
<br/>
Is <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> related to scarcity?&nbsp;&nbsp;If so, then what shall be done with it?<br/>
