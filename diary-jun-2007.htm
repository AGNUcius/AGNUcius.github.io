Lord <a href="agnu.htm">AGNU</a>cius replies:<br/>
Thanks for replying, I was worried my wording was too abrupt.<br/>
<br/>
I understand you wanting to inform others, as the situation is dire, and I was doing the same when I first began to awake...<br/>
<br/>
Your assumption that we must inform many people is a common one, and I don't mean to belittle it, but it is not as set in stone as many believe.<br/>
<br/>
The common held vision is that we must reform <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent corporations in some way.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some think we can convince them through protest or boycott, but since we don't have any <a href="real.htm">real</a>istic alternatives, that cannot <a href="work.htm">work</a>, since those attending the rallies must go to War*Mart on the way home to get toilet paper.&nbsp;&nbsp;Others think we should have government |force| them to "be nice", but that only swells the NWO power - especially as we are already headed this direction through UN and EU mandates, as well as North American Union <small>(NAU)</small>, Security and Prosperity <a href="part.htm">Part</a>nership <small>(SPP)</small> as well as international fines imposed through <a href="free.htm">Free</a> <a href="trad.htm">Trad</a>e <a href="agree.htm">Agree</a>ments <small>(CAFTA/NAFTA/*FTA)</small> etc. such as the Codex Aliementarius which limit our <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom of choice over things as seemingly mundane as allowed concentration of Vitamin C in supplements - and requiring registration of plant and animal varieties that we can raise ourselves which would threaten corporate <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so that was a diversion, but the point I'm trying to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e is that we can accomplish this in an incremental, bottom-up approach through a contract applied to private <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty that will cause a community that grows around those physical re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es to outperform the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy from within.&nbsp;&nbsp;This viral approach is already ruining <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> that is usually collected by <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers through <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity of <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es for my industry <small>(software)</small>, while not harming the Wages paid to <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers for the value they add.<br/>
<br/>
It is <a href="hard.htm">hard</a> for me to describe what I mean, but it is actually quite simple.<br/>
<br/>

Private <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty syndication is the same pattern Ric<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> <a href="stallman.htm">Stallman</a> <a href="use.htm">use</a>d for <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is slow and small at first, but grows exponentially as the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a is understood and as it outperforms the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>el.<br/>
<br/>
This private law can be applied to any business, but, just as with the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>, <a href="own.htm">own</a>er<small>(s)</small> must CHOOSE to apply it to their <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, so at first it will only be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d by small inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s who understand it and want to apply it to a <a href="start.htm">start</a>up business that they intend to treat as a public utility.<br/>
<br/>
An example small enough for initial investment by just one person is the physical assets required to begin hosting an online community intended to be a stable alternative to the <a href="web.htm">Web</a> 2.0 <a href="start.htm">start</a>ups <small>(Feedburner.*)</small> that are otherwise suddenly aquired once they reach <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>erate size.&nbsp;&nbsp;By applying <a href="gplv4.htm">GPLv4</a> from the <a href="start.htm">start</a>, so that *<a href="real.htm">real</a>* <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of the corporation is distributed just as fast as it grows through <a href="user.htm">User</a> investment <small>(as measured by the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> that <a href="user.htm">user</a> <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s above the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s they inflict upon the physical assets)</small>, then any such buyout attempt will only apply to the <a href="real.htm">real</a>istically divisible sub-set of <a href="user.htm">user</a>/<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers that CHOOSE to allow it.&nbsp;&nbsp;All other <a href="user.htm">user</a>s are sovereign to remain organized because of their <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.&nbsp;&nbsp;This should <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e it clear that the software <a href="use.htm">use</a>d on those servers must be <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software for such divisions to be painless.&nbsp;&nbsp;At that point, the only thing I can see that might get in the way because it is indivisible would be <a href="trad.htm">Trad</a>emark and Domain Name issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't yet <a href="know.htm">know</a> what to do about that.<br/>
<br/>
I have thought much about buying a small <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>ding in a commercial district which would <a href="start.htm">start</a> as a kind of multi-purpose internet-cafe surrounded by permaculture which would grow out of my control to include things such as clothes-washing <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hines, pizza ovens, even eventually <small>(in separate <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>dings)</small> auto mechanic and wood-<a href="work.htm">work</a>ing equipment, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers never lose any more control than they are willing to put up for aquisition by the growth of others.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if I didn't need help <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing off the <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>ding, and wanted to retain full vote-control over it, then <a href="user.htm">User</a> growth would go toward the purchase of another <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>ding under the same corporation, but maybe even located far away if the investing Consumers happen to be traveling to <a href="use.htm">use</a> the facilities...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I sure hope this <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es sense.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason I have not already <a href="start.htm">start</a>ed such an endeavor is that I need help&nbsp;&nbsp;with the wording and finalization of the <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy you appear to understand this approach, and hope you will write your <a href="own.htm">own</a> interpretation to help describe it to others.<br/>

Organisms <small>(fungi, flora and fauna)</small> that are <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful to humans can be thought of as slow motion, self-replicating, solar powered factories for the raw materials of food, drugs, fiber and <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>ding materials.<br/>
<br/>
People talk about desktop manufacturing and fancy technology as though it might solve our problems, but the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of the deepest <small>(most inescapably important)</small> issues of food, medicine, clothing and shelter have been available since before humans even existed, and things are only getting worse in that regard.<br/>

This information may <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e you angry, and may <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e you desire to attack me as the messenger, but that will not help solve the issue. We must face this dark truth if we are to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e headway against it. I am not blaming anyone, I am only trying to help us see that it is not an accident that abundance is suppressed, it is the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent purpose of political <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy.<br/>
<br/>
PermaCulture as a term may be fairly <a href="new.htm">new</a>, but the concept is ancient. The emotionless reason it is not already in place <small>(and why it is being removed even as we speak)</small> everywhere in the world is because of how <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom and abundance conflict with <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Permanent Culture will be a natural and unavoidable side effect once <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is understood to be a measure of Consumer dependence and plea for growth and treated as an investment for that same Consumer.<br/>

<span class="quot">> If you created your <a href="own.htm">own</a> religion, what would it be like?&nbsp;&nbsp;One condition - it has to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e sense to an alien visitor who <a href="know.htm">know</a>s nothing about human beings.</span><br/>
<br/>
I respond as Lord <a href="agnu.htm">AGNU</a>cius with:<br/>
<br/>
There's so much that could be tried... Let's see what has already been done:<br/>
<br/>
Maybe hijacking our innate desire for physical salvation by pretending to see a vision of the CHI RHO <small>(that's an X overlaid by a P ... hm, did you <a href="know.htm">know</a> the pre-release codename for Microsoft's XP was Cairo?)</small> with the slogan <span class="quot">"'In This Sign Conquer'"</span> while staring into the SUN, and then re-running the ancient birth/death/rebirth Phoenix Fire Mystery Hero figure representing the Daily and Yearly cycles of the SUN - even dangerously placing the death at December 22 <small>(Winter Solstice)</small> and the rebirth 3 days later - when the SUN again begins to lengthen the day?&nbsp;&nbsp;Well that is already taken by Constantine and solidified during the Council of Nicea.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe you could <a href="start.htm">start</a> an offshoot of Masonry similar to that concocted by a <a href="gold.htm">gold</a> digging, 14 year-old marrying, son-of-a-drunk, polygamist <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>eer who bought Egyptian <a href="art.htm">art</a>ifacts from a traveling salesman and then sloppily pretended to interpret them besides hiding under a blanket to get someone else to write the bulk of what he would then claim as his <a href="own.htm">own</a> revelations?&nbsp;&nbsp;DAMN!&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="note.htm">Note</a> that when we concoct our lies they must be big Big BIG!<br/>
<br/>
Of course you already <a href="know.htm">know</a> about the Thetans, <a href="xen.htm">Xen</a>u and the DC-8s.<br/>
<br/>
Or how about <a class="ext" href="http://RAEL.org">RAEL.org</a> ~ hm, that is RA <small>(the SUN)</small> followed by EL <small>(the shortened version of Elohim)</small> - and also happens to be the last <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the word "Israel"...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I'm not <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing much of a religion myself here, but probably the best thing I've found in all of my study is the worship of Molech and the Cremation of Dull Care by our world 'leaders' that occurs each July 15th in Bohemian Grove in Sonoma County California and is heavily documented, including some films at:<br/>

<a class="ext" href="http://RealJournalism.net/times.htm">RealJournalism.net/times.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
And who can forget Masonry with the common catch-phrase "Masonry is not a religion; Masonry IS religion".<br/>
<br/>
I'm giving you 2 kudos just because it doesn't appear to <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> me anything.<br/>

<a href="rms.htm">RMS</a> did not beg the software companies to <a href="free.htm">Free</a> the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es to their <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts; he recognized that we could enforce an <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment between <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect instance <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers through private <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
Let's do the same for the physical world by writing a <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment that guarantees <a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom by <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ing the *physical* <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion incrementally come under the control of those <a href="user.htm">User</a>s whenever they <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> any <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> - so that what is usually called <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> becomes an investment in their name.<br/>
<br/>
This will distribute control in a dynamic manner based on the desire each <a href="user.htm">User</a> has for growth <small>(for <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is a measure of <a href="user.htm">User</a> dependence)</small>.<br/>

<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> inverts our original goals of abundance to those of <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity through destruction and pollution of all competing suppliers.&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is only true <small>(is only meaningful)</small> when <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect Consumers are not <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
When an <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect Consumer <small>(of say an apple)</small> <a href="own.htm">OWN</a>S the physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <small>(the tree, <a href="land.htm">land</a>, water rights, tools)</small> of it's <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, then he might <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> a <a href="work.htm">Work</a>er some Wage as a <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, but <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is undefined.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, if I <a href="own.htm">OWN</a> an apple orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> and sell you an apple, you will likely be willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> a <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> since you are not "set up" or 'developed' enough in that you don't already <a href="own.htm">OWN</a> the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Now, <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing a <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> is not something we should try to stop directly, as it is an accurate measure of your dependence, and therefore your desire to grow.<br/>
<br/>
Since you are willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> that <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence usually called <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, the best thing we <small>(<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers wishing to <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d community)</small> could do with that value is to treat it as an investment for you <small>(the Consumer)</small> in more physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es, or to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>off <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es that have already been purchased if the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers have trees up for sale.<br/>
<br/>
By doing this, the Consumers eventually become the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers and therefore controllers of the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion, and therefore of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
This <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>e of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion is a striking contrast to Marxism which would have the <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers be the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers and controllers.<br/>
<br/>
As <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect Consumers become <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers, <small>(this will never be 'perfect', as Consumer demand always changing, and hence <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership will continually 'flow')</small>, <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> disappears except as a measure of Consumer Growth - as it <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es no sense to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> more than <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> at that point unless you were to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> yourself!<br/>
<br/>
Please tell me in what way this logic is flawed.<br/>

<hr/><span class="date">Jun-28-07:</span> <a href="mail.htm">Mail</a> to NB subject: Levers of War<br/>
Nate,<br/>
<br/>
I've thinking about how I responded to your initial e<a href="mail.htm">mail</a>, and am worried I was too pushy <small>(as people tend to perceive me)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
You asked me a few questions and I overwhelmed you with completely unrelated barrage.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do this because I stupidly assume everyone is interested in finding out what is wrong, while almost every attempt I've ever made to talk&nbsp;&nbsp;with others about this has proven the opposite.<br/>
<br/>
So if this is boring for you please let me <a href="know.htm">know</a> by telling me directly, or even just by avoiding the subject <small>(which is what you originally did in that your first e<a href="mail.htm">mail</a> did not contain such material)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I hope I'm wrong, but in either case, to relieve some tension and to help you understand my position I will explain how the first two <small>(trick)</small> questions can be answered by considering the special case that occurs when *Consumers* <a href="own.htm">own</a> the "<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion":<br/>
<br/>
Q1. Is <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ment a need in itself?<br/>
A1. Having robots <a href="pic.htm">pic</a>k fruit <small>(a <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>y I recently saw)</small> can be a good thing, but only if we <small>(the Consumers)</small> <a href="own.htm">OWN</a> the farms - otherwise, we will be "put out of <a href="work.htm">work</a>" by solving the problem, but the output will not be ours after the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is complete.<br/>
<br/>
Q2. Must <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e be held above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <small>(must <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> be '<a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ed')</small>?<br/>
A2. When Consumers <a href="own.htm">OWN</a> a plant <small>(whether a factory or a tree)</small>, they may hire <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers and <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> Wages which are <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itionally and rightfully understood to be a <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, but could only <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> a <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> if they were investing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> needn't be '<a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ed', as it is UNDEFINED!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If this <a href="game.htm">game</a> <small>(we could call it "Levers of War" - since <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is increased by 'churn', and War is one of the best examples of that)</small> interests you, we should go to lunch sometime <small>(my treat)</small> so we can discuss it further.<br/>
<br/>
Your friend,<br/>
Patrick<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<hr/><span class="date">Jun-28-07:</span> <a href="mail.htm">Mail</a> to NB subject: Collapsing complexity<br/>
<span class="quot">> squat on a my<a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e page but it's blank - I'm just holding it in case it's</span><br/>
<br/>
I also opened a page on Rupert Murdoch's <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty at <a class="ext" href="http://MySpace.com/patware">MySpace.com/patware</a> and have even begun to <a href="use.htm">use</a> it a bit lately trying to plan a community with some of Cindy's siblings.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> As for question 3, I'm not sure how you would fairly gauge the *quality*</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> of a process' usage of a re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e, so quantity is the only thing I think</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> you could reliably and fairly tax/penalize.&nbsp;&nbsp;But comparing processes to</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> people may be a metaphorical stretch.</span><br/>
<br/>
Ok, we'll forget the OS analogy and just treat this directly:<br/>
<br/>
Pretend you are the leader of a nation, <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e or city <small>(I've been trying to design a video <a href="game.htm">game</a> along these lines, but have only written a small a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> about it)</small> and assume your goal is to maximize citizen welfare.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty tax <small>(in fact almost every kind of tax)</small> is <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently structured to penalize improvements instead of being weighted against those who hold more than their "fair share" from the rest of the community.<br/>
<br/>
But the concept of "fair share" is slippery at best, and in worst cases eliminates incentive by not allowing those that excel <small>(as measured by the wage others are willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>)</small> to advance above those that perform poorly - nevermind whether those <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erences are inhe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> or a matter of diligence.<br/>
<br/>
The discussion of "fair share" might more easily be discussed if we just jump to the solution even before fully exploring the description of the problem itself.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the most surprising thing about the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>e of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <small>(this is primarily the invention of <a href="rms.htm">RMS</a> and HG; I have only remixed and generalized their <a href="work.htm">work</a>)</small> is the simplicity that results as terms that were <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificially separated <small>(whether on purpose or by accident I cannot say)</small> are rejoined.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, "tax" is another way of talking about "<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>".<br/>
<br/>
And "collective private <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty" is another way to think of "public <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty".&nbsp;&nbsp;They both require a form of government - essentially a kind of law or <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment that determines how the re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es are to be handled.<br/>
<br/>
So let's say you and I and a handful of our friends decide to buy some physical re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es together - whether <a href="land.htm">land</a> or capital or a combination of both.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will almost certainly be required to begin a community that has a chance of being <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> from what we <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently suffer.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine things are going well, and some of us decide it would be nice to have a pool in the clubhouse.<br/>
<br/>
But what if you don't have any desire for a pool?&nbsp;&nbsp;Should you be required to invest in it?&nbsp;&nbsp;In a normal city you would likely have little choice, as you would have already paid taxes, and if most of the other wanted it, your vote would have little impact.<br/>
<br/>
But what if we were to structure things <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ly - so that there was never anything called "tax", and such decisions were "opt in" simply because if you didn't want the pool, you would just choose to not join in trying to raise the <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for the <a href="install.htm">install</a>ation.<br/>
<br/>
That's ok, but what if later you see everyone is having so much fun that you decide maybe it would be nice to take a dip?<br/>
<br/>
Like any physical re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e, a pool has <a href="real.htm">real</a> and re<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ing <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s that must be covered even after the initial investment <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;So even one of the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent joint <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers that had originally invested would still <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> "<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>" to the group of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers each time he <a href="use.htm">use</a>d the pool because of the impact he has against that re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantage he would have in <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing would be that his vote as to how the pool is handled would be weighted by his % of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, so in some matters he would have more control.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> a person <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s is what I meant when I asked whether tax should be based on "the *a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a>* that is withheld from the community", and includes things like the time of day <small>(<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> more during high demand)</small>, pollution <small>(jumping in dirty, screaming, smoking etc.)</small>, blocking others <small>(swimming wildly or splashing that annoys)</small>...&nbsp;&nbsp;I <a href="real.htm">real</a>ize many of these things would be <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult to enforce, but that is the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a anyway.<br/>
<br/>
When I asked if we should tax <small>(weight <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> against)</small> "*how* the re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e is <a href="use.htm">use</a>d" I'm talking about things that do NOT interfere with other swimmers, so should not be penalized.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent tax structure generally attempts to penalize <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, especially if the <a href="user.htm">user</a> is being compensated, so a good example of this would be to increase <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> if you were teaching someone to swim or if you were <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>ding a slide <small>(assuming the other <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers had voted and approved such an <a href="install.htm">install</a>ation)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Does this explanation at least show you why <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty tax <small>(for instance)</small> should be weighted against withholding instead of against the improvements you <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e to that <a href="land.htm">land</a>?&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent system rewards those that keep junk cars in their yard and <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>e in tents while penalizing those that keep things clean and <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d permanent structures.<br/>

I have thought extensively about this, and have written so much that it has become almost intractable.<br/>
<br/>
So, instead of trying to repeat it here, I would like to <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ose a distillate version, point to the primary document of my <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and ask for questions/corrections/concerns:<br/>
<br/>
<a href="user.htm">User</a>s <small>(whether consumers or <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers)</small> would become <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers through automatic investment in physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <small>(such as a fishing rod and rights to a stream)</small> whenever they <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> more than <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <small>(including wages)</small> for any <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect <small>(such as a fish)</small> that we would offer under restrictions analogous to those of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>.<br/>

I've been trying to think of another way to present this discovery about how to generalize the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>e of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion into the physical world - where <a href="user.htm">User</a>s <small>(consumers)</small> are <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers instead of an arbitrary group <small>(as is now)</small>, and in contrast to Marxism <small>(which would have the <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers be the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers)</small>, but I still cannot fit it all into a small <a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e, so I will just ask a small <a href="part.htm">part</a> of it to get you thinking:<br/>
<br/>
1. Is <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ment a need in itself?&nbsp;&nbsp;What if you are alone on an is<a href="land.htm">land</a>?&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens as we add more humans?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
3. If you were to create an <a href="operating system.htm">Operating System</a> that allowed individual process to allocate re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es amongst themselves, do you think 'TAX' should be based on *how* those procs <a href="use.htm">use</a> those re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, or should it be based on the *a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a>* they withhold from others?<br/>

I should have been more careful in my wording; when I wrote "our purposes" by 'our' I meant all of humanity, including the ~27,000 that die of starvation every day, and half of the planet that <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>e on less than $2 per day - which would include many of the Africans mentioned in the linked <a href="art.htm">art</a>icle.<br/>

<br/>
<span class="quot">> Anyway, to answer the first question, I don't <a href="know.htm">know</a> that corporate agriculture DOESN'T serve our purposes, I just think that, for me, I'd rather grow my <a href="own.htm">own</a> food, because I enjoy it, and it's cheaper.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for something that could be <a href="free.htm">free</a>? For me, it's fun planting something and watching it grow.&nbsp;&nbsp;But maybe it's not for everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;My whole thing is that I think the "grand design" is that the earth can provide everything we need.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think human greed throws off the balance.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> In my perfect society, everyone takes care of their family by providing food, water and shelter.&nbsp;&nbsp;What else do we need? The earth has enough water for everyone...&nbsp;&nbsp;we can grow our <a href="own.htm">own</a> food, and anyone can create something to keep the rain off your head at night.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in my perfect world, things are a little simpler.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't <a href="know.htm">know</a> about all that other stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll probably never get to <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>e my dream, but I'm <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing on it...&nbsp;&nbsp;maybe someday.</span><br/>

Max, being especially interested in plants, could you give me a summary of what you believe to be the reason corporate agriculture does not serve our purposes?<br/>
<br/>
Is impossible to accomplish our goals through <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e, or must every human resort to raising their <a href="own.htm">own</a> food, medicine and fiber?<br/>
<br/>
What about other industries? What is wrong with the division of labor? Why can't the consumer <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly get what they want?<br/>
<br/>
Along those lines, what do you <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e of this African <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omist pleading "For God's Sake, Please Stop the Aid!".<br/>

It is somewhat confusing that "<a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software" and "Open <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e" are nearly the same set, and it is also unfortunate that the word '<a href="free.htm">Free</a>' is almost invariably confused with <a href="free.htm">Free</a>ware or with concern over <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e - sometimes even giving the impression that it cannot be 'Commercial'.<br/>

I hope you will listen.<br/>
<br/>
I wish someone could hear.<br/>
<br/>
I have discovered what is wrong with our <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic <a href="operating system.htm">Operating System</a>, and <small>(this is where you will turn away)</small> have even found a straight-forward solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that so unbelievable?&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no solution, then why even try?&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a solution, then won't it need to be found by someone?<br/>
<br/>
Ok, if you are still reading, here is another attempt to describe the problem:<br/>
<br/>
The photo for June 24, 2007 shows Melisa Christensen's poster which asks "Why don't our companies care?".<br/>
<br/>
That question has a faulty assumption <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>t into it that we consumers tend to overlook or maybe have given up on solving - an assumption that the companies are somehow 'ours'.<br/>
<br/>
We <small>(the consumers)</small> do not <a href="own.htm">OWN</a> the corporations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporations run almost every government on earth, and yet WE do not <a href="own.htm">OWN</a> any of them.<br/>
<br/>
This is a terrible problem because when the <a href="own.htm">OWN</a>ership of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es is not held by those that will consume the outputs of those <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, then the disease of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> begins to cause those groups of <a href="own.htm">OWN</a>ers to <a href="work.htm">work</a> against the rest of humanity to <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificially increase scarcity through destruction and pollution of all <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es that they do not <a href="own.htm">OWN</a> - so they may 'corner' the market, thereby further increasing <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> has nothing to do with <a href="work.htm">work</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wages for <a href="work.htm">work</a> are rightly considered a <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, and are usually based on the performance of that laborer.&nbsp;&nbsp;But <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between Consumer_<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e and <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a plea from the consumer - an admittance by that consumer that he is dependent on the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">OWN</a>ers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is an inverse measure of development and a direct measure of power over those that are vulnerable because of their lack of <a href="own.htm">OWN</a>ership in <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A solution:<br/>
If we <small>(the consumers)</small> were to begin forming corporations where any <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e a consumer paid above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <small>(what is usually called <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> were to be an investment for that same consumer in more <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, then the <a href="own.htm">OWN</a>ership of the corporations and hence the control of our earth would be disbursed in direct <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ortion to the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> each human is willing to invest <small>(as <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is a perfect measure of a consumer's desire to grow)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
These corporations would easily outperform all others as consumers would no longer <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the externality of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> to feudalist usurists, so <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e would eventually equal <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s - a condition most corporations consider failure, and is the reason small farmers <small>(and other, less important businesses)</small> cannot 'compete'.<br/>
<br/>
Consumer <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed farms would hire talented farmers, and likely <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> them more than they <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e while safely pushing <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e toward <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.<br/>

<br/>
I think I <a href="know.htm">know</a> how to fix this.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="real.htm">Real</a>ly.<br/>
<br/>
We could create an inter-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er contract patterned after the FSF's <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>, but for assets in the physical <a href="real.htm">real</a>m.<br/>
<br/>
Once written, small-time inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s could choose to apply it to some of their physical <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty in the same way <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers already choose to apply the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> to information.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>eled after the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>, this contract must <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e the <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom of every <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="user.htm">User</a>, but since we are talking about physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es that have <a href="real.htm">real</a> and re<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ing <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s, we must also talk about <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y.<br/>
<br/>
A minimal description of this structure is easier to understand when we <a href="real.htm">real</a>ize that <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional '<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>' is a measure of <a href="user.htm">User</a> dependence on <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between <a href="user.htm">User</a>_<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e and <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s <small>(where <a href="work.htm">Work</a>er_Wages are an <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er_<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> by the way)</small>, and may be offset or balanced by causing any such revenue to become an investment for that <a href="user.htm">User</a> toward more physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es needed to <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e future <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
Through such a contract, <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership <small>(and hence control)</small> would flow to those willing to invest - as indicated by their willingness to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> more than <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> for the re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es they consume.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, by applying such a contract to the <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ware needed to host the kinds of software that <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e up the services you mention, the community of <a href="user.htm">User</a>s that grows around those physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es would be guaranteed to remain in control no matter how large the organization grew.<br/>
<br/>
The collective <a href="user.htm">User</a>/<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers would decide how to run things through vote weights based directly on their percentage of holding and otherwise split according to <a href="real.htm">real</a>istic divisibility of the physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone interested in syndicating <a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom can choose to grow such a corporation by purchasing some physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion and then applying a private law as describe above that <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>es any a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> paid above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <small>(what would usually be called '<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>')</small> be an investment for that <a href="user.htm">User</a> - since <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is admitting they are vulnerable - and hence should be interpreted as a cry for investment toward more physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
On a more complicated <a href="note.htm">note</a>, it seems to me a community <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency should be issued and <a href="back.htm">back</a>ed by those same physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es, but this is still fuzzy to me...<br/>

<span class="quot">>The incremental <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of data is near zero, it can be extraordinarily <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>ly to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">>Similarly, the incremental <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age and expression is nearly zero, whatever the initial <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of the <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter and <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age is.</span><br/>
<br/>
Yes, but how does this <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>er from the incremental <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es required for bread <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion?<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s to maintain any physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <small>(whether a tractor or a <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter)</small> are usually much smaller than the initial investment while the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s to operate those <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es might be quite high - as they include wages for the <a href="work.htm">Work</a>er <small>(to drive the tractor or program the <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter)</small> and energy <small>(diesel or electricity)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
It is the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>iculty in organizing large collective investments that keeps <a href="user.htm">User</a>s <small>(Consumers)</small> from <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion that would allow us to then have "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" access and full control of the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
If a group of <a href="user.htm">User</a>s <small>(Consumers)</small> were to incorporate and purchase some physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es that they voluntarily put under a contract that required all <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> at each transaction be targeted as an investment for that very <a href="user.htm">user</a> in more physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es, then that collective <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership would grow according to the interest of the <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipants until it would soon outperform large holders - whether they be Google or ConAgra.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how we could prove it is the <a href="user.htm">User</a>s <small>(Consumers)</small> who must <a href="own.htm">OWN</a> for optimum <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic efficiency, and who will otherwise continue to beg and wonder why those that do <a href="own.htm">OWN</a> withhold access for the purposes of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> <small>(usury)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
I've thought to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e an MMORPG that <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>eled a simple but <a href="real.htm">real</a>istic society centered around bread <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion which would include private <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty and the requirement to eat <small>(say one loaf)</small> each day.<br/>

<br/>
Arikan,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for responding, but your stance is not clear to me, so I want to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e sure you understand my claim.<br/>
<br/>
Do you <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> or dis<a href="agree.htm">agree</a> that the <a href="user.htm">User</a>s <small>(or the more <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional term "Consumers")</small> should be in control of the physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion?&nbsp;&nbsp;This is, of course, in glaring contrast to the Marxist dream of <a href="work.htm">Work</a>er control.<br/>
<br/>
This not just a stab-in-the-dark without purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="user own.htm">User own</a>ership of physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es creates an interesting dynamic where <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s are 'internalized' <small>(eliminating externalities)</small>; <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> becomes meaningless except as <a href="user.htm">User</a> growth; abundance and low <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es are never a threat; <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ment is understood as a <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> to be minimized, not a need in itself.<br/>
<br/>
When Ric<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> <a href="stallman.htm">Stallman</a> and Eben Moglen speak of <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom in the <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual <a href="real.htm">real</a>m, it is always "<a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom" that they are concerned with.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software enables every <a href="user.htm">User</a> to gain control of that information, and is not restricted to the Authors <small>(original inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s)</small> or to any other group such as qualified <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers or any withholder of intellect.<br/>
<br/>
I hope we can <a href="work.htm">work</a> together to write an inter-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment in the spirit of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> that can be applied to some collectively <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es so that <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership <small>(and hence control)</small> will flow to each <a href="user.htm">User</a> as anything they <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <small>(what would usually be called <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> would become an investment for them in more physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es so the society that forms around that joint-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership will be truly <a href="free.htm">free</a>.<br/>

I must most cautiously push against this very common misunderstanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that copying any information such as software, music, videos, text, DNA, has small <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s, but they are certainly not zero.<br/>
<br/>
By incorrectly calling the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s zero we have led ourselves to believe that hosting is unimportant, but that is clearly false when we begin to discuss why it is that Google, My<a href="spac.htm">Spac</a>e, etc. are not doing what we <small>(the consumers)</small> want.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because we do not <a href="own.htm">own</a> the physical <a href="land.htm">land</a>, <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>dings and tools that those corporations need to Host and Express that information.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the same problem for any and all business that *seem* to have nothing to do with <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual materials.<br/>

<br/>
"<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ers" sometimes means "<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers" and sometimes means "<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers".<br/>
<br/>
If you mean "<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers" then of course they are already in control.<br/>
<br/>
If you mean "<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers" then you create the <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>e that Marx dreamt of, and which might be temporarily slightly better than what we experience now.<br/>
<br/>
If you mean "Consumers" <small>(you probably don't)</small> then you create the <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>e that <a href="rms.htm">RMS</a> invented through the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>, and is the most correct arrangement.<br/>
<br/>
As an example, when you <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of copying an apple, which would you say is better:<br/>
<br/>
1. An arbitrary, non-<a href="work.htm">work</a>ing group of <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers control the care <small>(they may <a href="spray.htm">spray</a> the orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> with dangerous chemicals)</small> of those <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es, and can charge a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> to <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> limited only by other competing <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
2. Marxism - where the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers are the <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers that plant, water, maintain and harvest the fruit.&nbsp;&nbsp;They control the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es similarly to the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers in <small>(1)</small>, but at least they can <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> themselves a higher Wage.&nbsp;&nbsp;The consumer still has little control, is not allowed to do any of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> himself, and is still at the mercy of those who <a href="own.htm">Own</a>.<br/>
<br/>
3. The perfect* <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>e where the collective <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers are the Consumers themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;They can <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e the copies themselves <small>(tend their portion of the orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> in the manner they see fit - and within the constraint of <a href="real.htm">real</a>istic divisibility)</small>, or they may hire others to <a href="work.htm">work</a> for them, but either way we <small>(the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s/consumers)</small> are in complete control.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>e also causes <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e to be the same as <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>, as <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> has no meaning when the consumer <a href="own.htm">Own</a>s the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es - or in other words, if the Consumer did <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> it, he would be <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing himself.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span><small>(3)</small> is not achievable in a perfect or <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ic manner <small>(especially during the initial growth period)</small> because the consumer may not yet <a href="own.htm">Own</a> the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es that were <a href="use.htm">use</a>d during the round of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion that created that exact <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect, but this <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>e can always be "approached" by <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers who choose to apply an inter-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er contract that requires any <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> paid by consumers be an investment in more <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, or toward <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing-off some <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent investments, and that that those shares become the semi-divisible <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of that very same consumer.<br/>

As re<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es are consumed or destroyed, <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> increases, so this is great for those who believe <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> <small>(Usury)</small> is our goal.<br/>
<br/>
If we <small>(the Consumers)</small> could awake from this lie to understand Abundance to be the goal <small>(which is bad for <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> by the way)</small>, we could become <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers ourselves, which - in that special case - would cause <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> to be undefined, and therefore no longer be an incentive to destroy and <a href="delet.htm">delet</a>e our inheritance.<br/>
<br/>
These consuming <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers or "Conducers" would strive to internalize <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s at every step, as the goal would be <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and abundance, never the filthy goal of usurous <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Some Georgists say "Keep all that you <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e, <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for all that you take", but somehow still think <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> - which is NOT Wages of course - is OK, even though it is an accumulation of wealth by non-<a href="work.htm">work</a>ing <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers through leverage against those that are not already "set up".<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is a measure of Consumer dependence, and increases as those Consumers have less options for direct access the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion themselves.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> should be an investment for those Consumers in the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership of more <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of that same kind.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way a group of humans can create a stable <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy that internalizes <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s while laughing at those that 'dump' <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t on their shores, as the goal is always abundance, since <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is meaningless when the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect Consumers are the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers.<br/>

How long will we <small>(the Consumers)</small> beg the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers of the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion to do the right thing instead of becoming the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers ourselves?<br/>
<br/>
Why are we so frightened to <a href="own.htm">OWN</a>?<br/>
<br/>
Let's write a contract that <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers can begin to apply to the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion - a kind of inter-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment that causes <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership to be distributed at each purchase to any Consumer that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
This will internalize <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s and stop the parasitic <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> <small>(which is an externality BY DEFINITION)</small> which otherwise rewards the opposite of abundance.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the disease that is increased as Consumers are subjucated.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is inversely related to the development of a people.<br/>
<br/>
If a <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>eer were selling water, do you think he would want the Consumers to have "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" access to water otherwise?<br/>
<br/>
It is in the best interest of corporations - that define their success by keeping <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> - to deny the advancement of the humans they exploit, as that <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom is bad for their 'market'.<br/>
<br/>
This is not a moral issue, it is one of re<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e allocation which - in it's <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent form - causes control to NOT flow to those that deserve it most.<br/>
<br/>
Until we fix this <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>amental trouble with our system by writing a contract that <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers can choose to apply to <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion which causes shares of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership to be transfered to each consumer at each <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e, the destruction of our planet will continue to accelerate - as destruction of all other alternative <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es rewards those that would sell us the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion while withholding the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es so they may exact Usury which is defined as any <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e paid above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is not good.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not even neutral.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is evil because it rewards the opposite of abundance.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, Wages are not <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we <small>(the consumers)</small> <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ed the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion, we could then <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers even more than they <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently receive, yet our <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e "at the pump" would be reduced dramatically since the concept of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> becomes meaningless.<br/>
<br/>
I <a href="know.htm">know</a> you will think this is a worthless <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone I tell it too thinks it has no merit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh well.&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose you <small>(everyone)</small> will continue to beg the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers, and otherwise fatten government and lose sovereignty to the NWO as we play into their hands.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could communicate this message.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why can nobody hear?<br/>

We consumers must <a href="own.htm">OWN</a> physical assets or we will BE <a href="own.htm">OWN</a>ED by those who do.<br/>
<br/>
Let us organize and begin to purchase some physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion which we can hold between ourselves under a special contract that requires each and any <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="user.htm">user</a> to become a <a href="part.htm">part</a>ial controlling shareholder in those <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <small>(or in <a href="new.htm">new</a> investment of similar <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es)</small> each and any time that consumer <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> for those goods or services.<br/>

This problem is <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>ntical for any and every business.<br/>
<br/>
We <small>(the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s/consumers)</small> do not control the composition or <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e of ANYTHING we purchase.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers have fooled us into believing we can 'demand', but in the end it is only the <a href="own.htm">OWN</a>ERS that decide.<br/>
<br/>
Why can't we have simple hybrid vehicles such as Henry Ford's experiment with the <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el A?&nbsp;&nbsp;Why can't we buy food or medicine that is safe and natural while <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing only the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s <small>(including the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers' wages)</small> for it's <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion?&nbsp;&nbsp;What if WE <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed the petrol fields, drills, tankers, trucks, etc.?&nbsp;&nbsp;We could <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers far more than they <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently receive while the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e at the pump would be far less since the externality of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> becomes meaningless when the consumer <small>(say of an apple)</small> is the <a href="own.htm">OWN</a>ER of the physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es for that <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect <small>(the <a href="land.htm">land</a>, trees, tractors, water rights, tools, etc.)</small>.<br/>

Hello fellow peers.<br/>
<br/>
I've been thinking about the personal manufacturing <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a for a while, but Derek's last comment has given me yet another reason to post.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope these points can be taken with the spirit of kindness I attempt to deliver them in.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1. What is it about capitalism that <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es it so consumers are not already in control?&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when a well-meaning entrepreneur begins yet another business to address this issue, why is it that once that business grows to even <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>erate size that our <small>(the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s')</small> voice seems to lose impact?&nbsp;&nbsp;If you claim that isn't the case, and there is no problem, then why do we see such efforts as <a class="ext" href="http://Ponoko.com?">Ponoko.com?</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;If it IS the case, is there <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly nothing we <small>(the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s)</small> could ever do to prevent it?&nbsp;&nbsp;What if the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s happened to also be the initial inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s, and therefore the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers and controllers of the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion?&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly there would be nobody in the way then right?&nbsp;&nbsp;But consumer desire changes, so control - and therefore <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership should probably change too.&nbsp;&nbsp;Could we write a contract that <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers could choose to apply between themselves so that <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership would 'flow' to <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="user.htm">user</a>s according to the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> those <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="user.htm">user</a>s choose to invest, and <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership would be slowly taken from old <a href="user.htm">user</a>s that fail to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the re<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ing <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of maintaining those <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es?<br/>
<br/>
2. <a href="use.htm">Use</a>ful <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>ing organisms are tiny factories.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice how the word 'plant' is also <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to indicate the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of manufacturing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fungi, flora and fauna are slow-motion, solar powered matter replicators <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing the raw materials of food, medicine, <a href="soap.htm">soap</a>, clothing, shelter and fuel.<br/>
<br/>
3. <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers can contract to <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e the labor and <a href="skill.htm">skill</a> needed to create <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="free.htm">free</a> designs - whether mechanical layouts, software, music, GMOs, etc. *before* performing that <a href="work.htm">work</a>, but trying to earn <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y through the old practice of copy restriction will be less and less viable as culture becomes more <a href="free.htm">free</a>.<br/>

Michel,<br/>
<br/>
Hello.&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Patrick Anderson.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; I have been following the P2P blog for some time now hoping to find the right time or place to present the result of about 7 years of study attempting to generalize the <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>e of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion created between <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers through the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a> into the physical world.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; My results align well with the goals and even the words chosen by <a href="rms.htm">RMS</a> to describe how society should act.<br/>
<br/>
The message is <small>[with physical-world analogy in pa<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>hesis]</small>:<br/>
&nbsp; <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom for <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect-code <a href="user.htm">user</a>s <small>(<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t consumers)</small> is determined by access to the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es <small>(Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion)</small> for those <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects, and can be syndicated and enforced between authors <small>(<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers)</small> who choose to apply a license <small>(contract or private law)</small> to those <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects so each <a href="user.htm">user</a> becomes a competitor <small>(<a href="own.htm">own</a>er)</small> anytime such an <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect is shared <small>(<a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ed)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The physical world is <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> from the <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual, but they actually cannot be separated.&nbsp;&nbsp;The physical world is a 'host' for the <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual. No information can exist without mass and energy required to <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>e and express it.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Of course you <a href="know.htm">know</a> the physical world is rivalrous, so this goal is far beyond the scope of a copyright license.&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally I thought we might fix this with a <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>al contract I called the General Public Lease, but after a while I <a href="real.htm">real</a>ized the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> is an <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment between <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers for the purpose of <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ing <a href="user.htm">user</a>s, but it is not an EULA because it imposes no restrictions during private <a href="use.htm">use</a>, only at the point of <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
