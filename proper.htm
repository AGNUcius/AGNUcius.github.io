Information is not <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty because, being non-rivalrous, it has no '<a href="proper.htm">proper</a>' <a href="own.htm">own</a>er aside from initial privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any attempts to constrain it's <a href="use.htm">use</a> beyond initial privacy break the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public law.htm">General Public Law</a>, including denying "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" access to it's <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
In contrast, <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of physical things is important for the stability of privacy and the <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom to exclude.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty may be:<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Personal: Single-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er controls the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of his <a href="own.htm">OWN</a> <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes called 'Private'.<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> <a href="prop.htm">Prop</a>rietary: Joint-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers control the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ectives of OTHERS.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes called 'Private' or 'Privatization'.&nbsp;&nbsp;All capitalist corporations and any supposed 'representative' government is <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>rietary because only a select few control and <a href="real.htm">real</a>istic divisibility <small>(secession)</small> is disallowed.<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Public: Joint-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers control the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of their <a href="own.htm">OWN</a> <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="real.htm">Real</a> Public <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty is mostly confined to very small groups because these organizations become <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>rietary as more humans join when the <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is also controlled by the originators.&nbsp;&nbsp;Joint <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership can remain public even while scaling if <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is treated as a <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er's Investment as outlined in the <a href="general public law.htm">General Public Law</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One way human beings <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>er from other organisms in our notion of physical <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership as a socially binding "<a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment" that pits not just that <a href="own.htm">own</a>er, but the entire community against those that would otherwise take our belongings or occupy our <a href="land.htm">land</a> just because they are stronger or more vicious.<br/>
<br/>
But private <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty law is not "dynamic" enough for the collective <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership we <a href="use.htm">use</a> to <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e labor for specialization.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty law is a bit too powerful when it comes to re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es that would be more effectively held "in common".&nbsp;&nbsp;By "in common" I'm referring to the purpose of either of what is <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itionally thought of as a "public utility" or as a "corporation".<br/>
<br/>
Whether by government or through incorporation, this <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ed <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty needs a constraint as negative-feed<a href="back.htm">back</a> to stop originators from excessive control through accumulation caused when <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is treated as a reward for their beginning the organization.<br/>
<br/>
Primative accumulation can be thought of as a largely ignorant and therefore even accidental result of an imbalance having a positive-feed<a href="back.htm">back</a> loop created by mistreating <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as though it were the <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers instead of understanding it to be an investment from the late-coming <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
From <a class="ext" href="http://MySpace.com/patware">MySpace.com/patware</a>:<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> at each <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e treated as consumer investment holds an <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy in a kind of tension that drives <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e toward <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> and allows un<a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ment <small>(leisure)</small> to safely approach zero while also removing the externality of the general form of Usury.<br/>
<br/>
Usury is not just high interest on <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y; it is the misap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riation of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> designed to perpetuate consumer dependence.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between consumer <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e and <a href="own.htm">own</a>er <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s, where those <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s include investments, <a href="work.htm">work</a>er wages, maintenance, etc..&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is not needed by society, it is simply a measure of an <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect consumer's plea for growth, so should always be treated as their <a href="own.htm">own</a> investment <small>(they are the one that just paid it after all)</small> toward more Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es for future <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of more of that kind of <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect.<br/>
<br/>
This continuous distribution creates perfected competition and direct democracy, therefore eliminating the faulty reward <small>(Usury)</small> which otherwise drives corporations to invert abundance through <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity.<br/>
