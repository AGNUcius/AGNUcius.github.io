&nbsp;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA<br/>
&nbsp;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br/>
&nbsp;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preamble<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br/>
<a href="free.htm">free</a>dom to share and change it.&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast, the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> General Public<br/>
License is intended to guarantee your <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom to share and change <a href="free.htm">free</a><br/>
software--to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e sure the software is <a href="free.htm">free</a> for all its <a href="user.htm">user</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;This<br/>
<a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a> applies to most of the <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software<br/>
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br/>
using it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>(Some other <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software Foundation software is covered by<br/>
the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> Lesser <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a> instead.)</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;You can apply it to<br/>
your programs, too.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; When we speak of <a href="free.htm">free</a> software, we are referring to <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom, not<br/>
<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a>s are designed to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e sure that you<br/>
have the <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom to distribute copies of <a href="free.htm">free</a> software <small>(and charge for<br/>
this service if you wish)</small>, that you receive <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code or can get it<br/>
if you want it, that you can change the software or <a href="use.htm">use</a> pieces of it<br/>
in <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="free.htm">free</a> programs; and that you <a href="know.htm">know</a> you can do these things.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; To <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> your rights, we need to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e restrictions that forbid<br/>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br/>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br/>
distribute copies of the software, or if you <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify it.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br/>
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br/>
you have.&nbsp;&nbsp;You must <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br/>
<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code.&nbsp;&nbsp;And you must show them these terms so they <a href="know.htm">know</a> their<br/>
rights.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; We <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> your rights with two steps: <small>(1)</small> copyright the software, and<br/>
<small>(2)</small> offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br/>
distribute and/or <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify the software.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Also, for each author's <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ion and ours, we want to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e certain<br/>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this <a href="free.htm">free</a><br/>
software.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the software is <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified by someone else and <a href="pass.htm">pass</a>ed on, we<br/>
want its recipients to <a href="know.htm">know</a> that what they have is not the original, so<br/>
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br/>
authors' reputations.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; Finally, any <a href="free.htm">free</a> program is threatened constantly by software<br/>
patents.&nbsp;&nbsp;We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a <a href="free.htm">free</a><br/>
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing the<br/>
program <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>rietary.&nbsp;&nbsp;To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br/>
patent must be licensed for everyone's <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="use.htm">use</a> or not licensed at all.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br/>
<a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ification follow.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public license.htm">GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</a><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND <a href="mod.htm">MOD</a>IFICATION<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 0. This License applies to any program or other <a href="work.htm">work</a> which contains<br/>
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br/>
under the terms of this <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Program", below,<br/>
refers to any such program or <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and a "<a href="work.htm">work</a> based on the Program"<br/>
means either the Program or any derivative <a href="work.htm">work</a> under copyright law:<br/>
that is to say, a <a href="work.htm">work</a> containing the Program or a portion of it,<br/>
either verbatim or with <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ifications and/or translated into another<br/>
language.&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br/>
the term "<a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ification".)</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br/>
<br/>
Activities other than copying, distribution and <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ification are not<br/>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.&nbsp;&nbsp;The act of<br/>
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br/>
is covered only if its contents constitute a <a href="work.htm">work</a> based on the<br/>
Program <small>(independent of having been made by running the Program)</small>.<br/>
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br/>
<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br/>
conspicuously and ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riately publish on each copy an ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riate<br/>
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br/>
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br/>
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br/>
along with the Program.<br/>
<br/>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br/>
you may at your option offer warranty <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ion in exchange for a fee.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 2. You may <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br/>
of it, thus forming a <a href="work.htm">work</a> based on the Program, and copy and<br/>
distribute such <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ifications or <a href="work.htm">work</a> under the terms of <a href="sect.htm">Sect</a>ion 1<br/>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a)</small> You must cause the <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified <a href="file.htm">file</a>s to carry prominent notices<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ing that you changed the <a href="file.htm">file</a>s and the date of any change.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b)</small> You must cause any <a href="work.htm">work</a> that you distribute or publish, that in<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whole or in <a href="part.htm">part</a> contains or is derived from the Program or any<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="part.htm">part</a> thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="part.htm">part</a>ies under the terms of this License.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c)</small> If the <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified program normally reads commands interactively<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when run, you must cause it, when <a href="start.htm">start</a>ed running for such<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interactive <a href="use.htm">use</a> in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; announcement including an ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riate copyright notice and a<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; notice that there is no warranty <small>(or else, saying that you provide<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a warranty)</small> and that <a href="user.htm">user</a>s may redistribute the program under<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these conditions, and telling the <a href="user.htm">user</a> how to view a copy of this<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License.&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does not normally print such an announcement, your <a href="work.htm">work</a> based on<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</small><br/>
<br/>
These requirements apply to the <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified <a href="work.htm">work</a> as a whole.&nbsp;&nbsp;If<br/>
<a href="ide.htm">ide</a>ntifiable <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ions of that <a href="work.htm">work</a> are not derived from the Program,<br/>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate <a href="work.htm">work</a>s in<br/>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br/>
<a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ions when you distribute them as separate <a href="work.htm">work</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;But when you<br/>
distribute the same <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ions as <a href="part.htm">part</a> of a whole which is a <a href="work.htm">work</a> based<br/>
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br/>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br/>
entire whole, and thus to each and every <a href="part.htm">part</a> regardless of who wrote it.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, it is not the intent of this <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion to claim rights or contest<br/>
your rights to <a href="work.htm">work</a> written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br/>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br/>
collective <a href="work.htm">work</a>s based on the Program.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, mere aggregation of another <a href="work.htm">work</a> not based on the Program<br/>
with the Program <small>(or with a <a href="work.htm">work</a> based on the Program)</small> on a volume of<br/>
a <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age or distribution medium does not bring the other <a href="work.htm">work</a> under<br/>
the scope of this License.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 3. You may copy and distribute the Program <small>(or a <a href="work.htm">work</a> based on it,<br/>
under <a href="sect.htm">Sect</a>ion 2)</small> in <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code or executable form under the terms of<br/>
<a href="sect.htm">Sect</a>ions 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a)</small> Accompany it with the complete corresponding <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine-readable<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code, which must be distributed under the terms of <a href="sect.htm">Sect</a>ions<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily <a href="use.htm">use</a>d for software interchange; or,<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b)</small> Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; years, to give any third <a href="part.htm">part</a>y, for a charge no more than your<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of physically performing <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e distribution, a complete<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine-readable copy of the corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code, to be<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; distributed under the terms of <a href="sect.htm">Sect</a>ions 1 and 2 above on a medium<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; customarily <a href="use.htm">use</a>d for software interchange; or,<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c)</small> Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to distribute corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code.&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>(This alternative is<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; received the program in <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code or executable form with such<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an offer, in accord with Sub<a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion b above.)</small><br/>
<br/>
The <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code for a <a href="work.htm">work</a> means the preferred form of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> for<br/>
<a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ifications to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;For an executable <a href="work.htm">work</a>, complete <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e<br/>
code means all the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code for all <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ules it contains, plus any<br/>
associated interface definition <a href="file.htm">file</a>s, plus the scripts <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to<br/>
control compilation and <a href="install.htm">install</a>ation of the executable.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as a<br/>
special exception, the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code distributed need not include<br/>
anything that is normally distributed <small>(in either <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e or binary<br/>
form)</small> with the major components <small>(<a href="compile.htm">compile</a>r, kernel, and so on)</small> of the<br/>
<a href="operating system.htm">operating system</a> on which the executable runs, unless that component<br/>
itself accompanies the executable.<br/>
<br/>
If distribution of executable or <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code is made by offering<br/>
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br/>
access to copy the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code from the same place counts as<br/>
distribution of the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code, even though third <a href="part.htm">part</a>ies are not<br/>
compelled to copy the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e along with the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 4. You may not copy, <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br/>
except as expressly provided under this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any attempt<br/>
otherwise to copy, <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br/>
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br/>
However, <a href="part.htm">part</a>ies who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br/>
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br/>
<a href="part.htm">part</a>ies remain in full compliance.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br/>
signed it.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, nothing else grants you permission to <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify or<br/>
distribute the Program or its derivative <a href="work.htm">work</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;These actions are<br/>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, by<br/>
<a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ifying or distributing the Program <small>(or any <a href="work.htm">work</a> based on the<br/>
Program)</small>, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br/>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ifying<br/>
the Program or <a href="work.htm">work</a>s based on it.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 6. Each time you redistribute the Program <small>(or any <a href="work.htm">work</a> based on the<br/>
Program)</small>, the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br/>
original licensor to copy, distribute or <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify the Program subject to<br/>
these terms and conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may not impose any further<br/>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br/>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third <a href="part.htm">part</a>ies to<br/>
this License.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br/>
infringement or for any other reason <small>(not limited to patent issues)</small>,<br/>
conditions are imposed on you <small>(whether by court order, <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment or<br/>
otherwise)</small> that con<a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ict the conditions of this License, they do not<br/>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you cannot<br/>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br/>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br/>
may not distribute the Program at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if a patent<br/>
license would not permit royalty-<a href="free.htm">free</a> redistribution of the Program by<br/>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br/>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br/>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br/>
<br/>
If any portion of this <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion is held invalid or unenforceable under<br/>
any <a href="part.htm">part</a>icular circumstance, the balance of the <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion is intended to<br/>
apply and the <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion as a whole is intended to apply in other<br/>
circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
It is not the purpose of this <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion to induce you to infringe any<br/>
patents or other <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty right claims or to contest validity of any<br/>
such claims; this <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion has the sole purpose of <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ing the<br/>
integrity of the <a href="free.htm">free</a> software distribution system, which is<br/>
implemented by public license practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people have made<br/>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br/>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br/>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br/>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br/>
impose that choice.<br/>
<br/>
This <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion is intended to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e thoroughly clear what is believed to<br/>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 8. If the distribution and/or <a href="use.htm">use</a> of the Program is restricted in<br/>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br/>
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br/>
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br/>
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br/>
countries not thus excluded.&nbsp;&nbsp;In such case, this License incorporates<br/>
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 9. The <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software Foundation may publish revised and/or <a href="new.htm">new</a> versions<br/>
of the <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a> from time to time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such <a href="new.htm">new</a> versions will<br/>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>er in detail to<br/>
address <a href="new.htm">new</a> problems or concerns.<br/>
<br/>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Program<br/>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any<br/>
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br/>
either of that version or of any later version published by the <a href="free.htm">Free</a><br/>
Software Foundation.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Program does not specify a version number of<br/>
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software<br/>
Foundation.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 10. If you wish to incorporate <a href="part.htm">part</a>s of the Program into other <a href="free.htm">free</a><br/>
programs whose distribution conditions are <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>, write to the author<br/>
to ask for permission.&nbsp;&nbsp;For software which is copyrighted by the <a href="free.htm">Free</a><br/>
Software Foundation, write to the <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software Foundation; we sometimes<br/>
<a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e exceptions for this.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our decision will be <a href="gui.htm">gui</a>ded by the two goals<br/>
of preserving the <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>us of all derivatives of our <a href="free.htm">free</a> software and<br/>
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NO WARRANTY<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED <a href="free.htm">FREE</a> OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br/>
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp;&nbsp;EXCEPT WHEN<br/>
OTHERWISE <a href="stat.htm">STAT</a>ED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER <a href="part.htm">PART</a>IES<br/>
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br/>
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br/>
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A <a href="part.htm">PART</a>ICULAR PURPOSE.&nbsp;&nbsp;THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br/>
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.&nbsp;&nbsp;SHOULD THE<br/>
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE <a href="cost.htm">COST</a> OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br/>
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR <a href="agree.htm">AGREE</a>D TO IN WRITING<br/>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER <a href="part.htm">PART</a>Y WHO MAY <a href="mod.htm">MOD</a>IFY AND/OR<br/>
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br/>
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br/>
OUT OF THE <a href="use.htm">USE</a> OR INABILITY TO <a href="use.htm">USE</a> THE PROGRAM <small>(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br/>
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br/>
YOU OR THIRD <a href="part.htm">PART</a>IES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br/>
PROGRAMS)</small>, EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER <a href="part.htm">PART</a>Y HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br/>
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to Apply These Terms to Your <a href="new.htm">New</a> Programs<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; If you develop a <a href="new.htm">new</a> program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br/>
possible <a href="use.htm">use</a> to the public, the best way to achieve this is to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e it<br/>
<a href="free.htm">free</a> software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; To do so, attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is safest<br/>
to attach them to the <a href="start.htm">start</a> of each <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="file.htm">file</a> to most effectively<br/>
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each <a href="file.htm">file</a> should have at least<br/>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a of what it does.><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copyright <small>(C)</small> &lt;year>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;name of author><br/>
