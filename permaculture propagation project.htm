Subject: "Garden A Feedin"<br/>
My <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>as complement and extend yours in these ways:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Allow you to target businesses and governments that are interested in the <a href="land.htm">land</a>scaping and an appearance of goodness <small>(helping the needy)</small>, but otherwise have no <a href="use.htm">use</a> of those outputs.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Help <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e a more continued <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ment through Service Contracts.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span> Help you and your business avoid government interference and lower your tax liability by receiving a portion of your income as the outputs themselves which you would then <a href="use.htm">use</a> directly.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a form of <a href="imput.htm">Imput</a>ed <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion that <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es you appear less wealthy than you <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly are - since there are then no numbers to report.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h3">===Target Markets</span><br/>
Businesses should not be overlooked, as they have large budgets and are always looking for a way to improve the <small>(mostly false)</small> notion that they care about something besides themselves.<br/>
<br/>
You can take advantage of those Public Relations <small>(PR)</small> <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s by helping to expose their contribution to the Greater-Good when they allow you to <a href="use.htm">use</a> their <a href="land.htm">land</a> and water to help Feed the Hungry through Local <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
This similarly applies to mid and high income households that would like to appear more 'green' to their neighbors, but do not have the time or will to deal with those 'manufacturing' plants themselves.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here is the approach in rough form:<br/>
A.)</small> We will <a href="install.htm">install</a> beautiful yet <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive plants for approximately the same <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e as non-<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive plants.<br/>
<br/>
B.)</small> We will optionally contract with you to tend those plants and harvest the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts in perpetutity at NO <a href="cost.htm">COST</a> to you except we will retain some % of that harvest as <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment.<br/>
<br/>
C.)</small> We will optionally process and <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>e your % at NO <a href="cost.htm">COST</a> to you except we will retain some further % of that harvest as <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment.<br/>
<br/>
D.)</small> We will optionally prepare your % into advanced solutions, even fully prepared meals at NO <a href="cost.htm">COST</a> to you except we will retain some % further of that harvest as <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h3">===Vertical Integration</span><br/>
As you gain more of these <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t-as-<a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>ment Service Contracts, you will finally have more output than you or your <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ees can <a href="use.htm">use</a> directly.<br/>
<br/>
At that point, you can begin using these raw materials as the inputs of other businesses such as creating Olive-oil, Almond-milk, Nut-based nutrition bars, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Later, you can even open restaurants supplied by those outputs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h3">===Business Orientation</span><br/>
Because of the nature of your endeavor, a carefully written "Mission <a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>ement" will qualify you as non-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
This would have NO EFFECT on the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y you or your <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers can keep as reward, it only requires you call those rewards *Wages* instead of *<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>* - it is a simple matter of book-keeping.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h3">===General <a href="ide.htm">Ide</a>as</span><br/>
For trees, concentrate on high-oil <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts such as Avacado, Olive, Nut - as they are much more valuable <small>(both nutritionally and <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>tarily)</small> than fruit.<br/>
<br/>
For small plants, don't forget spices and herbs, which are usually easy to grow, yet very expensive at the market.<br/>
<br/>
Off-the-shelf dog houses might be a simple basis for small Chicken shelters.<br/>
<br/>
Don't forget Bee Hives - informing potential customers of <a class="ext" href="http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_collapse_disorder">http://Wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_collapse_disorder</a> to increase their moral imperative.<br/>
