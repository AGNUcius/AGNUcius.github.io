&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why The <a href="gpl is bad.htm">GPL Is Bad</a> For The <a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omy<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a> <small>(<a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>)</small> is a software license from the <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software Foundation <small>(FSF)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Using <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty rights to stop power, the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> has begun a social unfolding that threatens the future of our <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy.<br/>
<br/>
Some have been misled into thinking the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> destroys <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as with any license, the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> is powerless unless <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is retained.<br/>
<br/>
In this document, the term 'The <a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omy' is applicable to any of capitalism, globalism, <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>es of Software<br/>
<br/>
Discussion of software licenses tends to revolve around whether or not the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code is OPEN.<br/>
<br/>
But licenses also independently address whether or not the software is LOCKED.<br/>
<br/>
These 2 attributes may be combined into 4 <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>es:<br/>
<br/>
1. LOCKED CLOSED: <small>[<a href="user.htm">User</a>s may NOT apply their <a href="own.htm">own</a> lock and <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e is NOT available]</small><br/>
<a href="prop.htm">Prop</a>rietary software is locked closed.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is illegal to open the gate <small>(reverse engineer)</small> or to apply your <a href="own.htm">own</a> lock.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="prop.htm">Prop</a>rietary software <small>(<a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional 'off the shelf' software)</small>, and most <a href="free.htm">free</a>ware or shareware are under these terms.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2. UNLOCKED CLOSED: <small>[<a href="user.htm">User</a>s may apply their <a href="own.htm">own</a> lock but <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e is NOT available]</small><br/>
This rare <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e describes software where <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e is not available, but the binaries may be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d for any <a href="use.htm">use</a> <small>(including reverse engineering)</small> and released under your <a href="own.htm">own</a> license.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some <a href="free.htm">free</a>ware is available under these terms especially abandoned projects where the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e was lost or destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3. UNLOCKED OPEN: <small>[<a href="user.htm">User</a>s may apply their <a href="own.htm">own</a> lock and <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e is available]</small><br/>
Any "<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e available" license that allows subsequent locking falls into this <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though copyright <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is retained, the license allows others to lock improvement to that <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty under their <a href="own.htm">own</a> terms.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example: a BSD license allowed Microsoft to <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d on the <a href="work.htm">work</a> of others, and then lock closed their TCP stack.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="osx.htm">OSX</a> <a href="use.htm">use</a>d <a href="part.htm">part</a>s of <a href="net.htm">Net</a>BSD and <a href="free.htm">Free</a>BSD, but hold the changes closed.<br/>
<br/>
Public Domain software is also UNLOCKED OPEN simply because copyright <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership has been relenquished.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4. LOCKED OPEN: <small>[<a href="user.htm">User</a>s may NOT apply their <a href="own.htm">own</a> lock but <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e is available]</small><br/>
This once rare <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e is enforced primarily by the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="prop.htm">Prop</a>rietary software shops dislike this <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e because it stops them from locking it closed, and because it <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>ds Swadeshi.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Software that is locked closed has many advantages for <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar to corporate tax relief, locked closed software rewards the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, while disempowering the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers and <a href="user.htm">user</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means higher <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ment, higher quality, and lower <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The locked open <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el destroys this important hierarchy by giving access to every <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter <a href="user.htm">user</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="art.htm">Art</a>ificial Scarcity<br/>
<br/>
<a href="art.htm">Art</a>ificial scarcity has been <a href="use.htm">use</a>d throughout hi<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>y to drive a <a href="pop.htm">pop</a>ulous to achieve goals they may be otherwise disinterested in.&nbsp;&nbsp;This ancient, powerful incentive is sometimes called hoarding by those wishing to eliminate it.<br/>
<br/>
While <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity is not required by capitalism, it is allowed, and accelerates the <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy in many ways.<br/>
<br/>
Locked closed software utilizes <a href="art.htm">Art</a>ificial scarcity in all its forms:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Form&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Access restriction:&nbsp;&nbsp; Per <a href="use.htm">use</a> licensing.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faulty by design:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purchase our other <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Planned obsolescence: Time limited version.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feature dearth:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incentive to buy "Pro" version.<br/>
<br/>
This allows <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers to create enormous taxable revenue from far less ingenuity and <a href="work.htm">work</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;We pretend this revenue will trickle down to the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers, but, being the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, we can always do as we please.<br/>
<br/>
Some <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers are paid, but <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers can never utilize <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> disables usury.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finite Re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es<br/>
<br/>
Finite re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es include:<br/>

<br/>
<a href="art.htm">Art</a>ificial scarcity of re<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ible items <small>(such as a grain of wheat)</small> can be a temporary incentive, but are <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult to enforce if the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er has access to finite re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
The only way to guarantee the incentive is to lock finite re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es closed.<br/>
<br/>
Continuing with the example of a grain of wheat, locking finite re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es closed guarantees the incentive in the following ways:<br/>
<br/>
1. <a href="art.htm">Art</a>ificial scarcity of <a href="land.htm">land</a> has been without a doubt the most successful incentive.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="land.htm">Land</a> hoarding has been <a href="use.htm">use</a>d since the beginning of time to create indentured servitude, and is still a major factor in perpetuating our vibrant <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Without <a href="land.htm">land</a>, the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er has nowhere to plant the wheat.&nbsp;&nbsp;He can <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> it from us, but then we can set the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e to ensure he never gets too far ahead.<br/>
<br/>
2. Water privatization is <a href="use.htm">use</a>d in many <a href="part.htm">part</a>s of Africa, in Bolivia, and at an accelerated pace throughout the world to get more <a href="work.htm">work</a> for less <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y.&nbsp;&nbsp;Without water the wheat will surely die.&nbsp;&nbsp;The exemplary Bechtel was especially dilligent in Bolivia: the privatization contract included charging for water collected from rooftops into cisterns.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this kind of management that <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es America what it is, and is the reason for such strong feelings about us all around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;The World <a href="bank.htm">Bank</a>, the IMF and ENRON should also be condemnded for pathing the way for these transnational corporations by perpetuating the debt that causes countries such as Argentina to finally sell off their natural re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, and enter the world <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy.<br/>
<br/>
3. Organism genetics are being locked closed by Monsanto and many other <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy minded corporations to increase dependence, lower security, and guarantee <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iraq COALITION PROVISIONAL AUTHORITY ORDER NUMBER 81 ensures "patent, industrial design, undisclosed information, integrated circuits and plant variety" are LOCKED CLOSED to ensure our domination of this people we have starved and bombed for nearly 20 years through the UN enforced sanctions continues.<br/>
<br/>
4. Many designs for tools such as plows, seed drills, irrigation systems, are luckily already locked closed, so the laborer won't be able to <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d his <a href="own.htm">own</a> unless he creates a <a href="new.htm">new</a> design - but even then it is likely to infringe on patents.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end he may <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> for whatever <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e we name and <a href="work.htm">work</a> for whatever wage we name or be looked down upon as a homeless slob.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="art.htm">Art</a>ificial scarcity causes <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers to toil more than would otherwise be neccessary to sustain their <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent quality of life.&nbsp;&nbsp;This allows us to give a higher <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> margin at a lower <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is exactly why we Americans enjoy such low <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es from imported <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts, and why our corporations <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e such a killing overseas.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bananas from Honduras, coffee from Nicaragua, cocoa from Daloa, Disney shirts from Bangladesh, Nike shoes from China.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a powerful incentive to <a href="work.htm">work</a> that is the very foundation of our high standard of <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>ing.&nbsp;&nbsp;How dare these hippies attack our kingdom!<br/>
<br/>
Some <a href="use.htm">use</a> derogatory terms such as sweat shops, slave labor, slavery, trafficking, etc., but it is through these very processes that so much has been accomplished.&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise why would they begin <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing at the age of 9 at 15 cents per hour for 16 hours per day until they finally die?&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="art.htm">Art</a>ificial scarcity is a legal, honest, moral means of extracting the most good from this otherwise idle vermin.<br/>
<br/>
Teary eyed pleas from groups attacking this system include:<br/>
'"</span>Today, there is more food per person on earth, yet more people are hungry than ever before. Advocates of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>-driven, global '<a href="free.htm">free</a>' <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>ed that this form of globalization would ease food insecurity. Instead, it has led to even more malnutrition.'"</span> -- <a class="ext" href="http://foodfirst.org">foodfirst.org</a><br/>
<br/>
What they don't mention is that food insecurity of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er is the very foundation of our high quality of life.&nbsp;&nbsp;These <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>onents of so called "sustainable" practices are attempting to <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers from their duties by calling for <a href="land.htm">land</a> reform, permaculture, technology transfer, locked open education material and other finite re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e access.&nbsp;&nbsp;If successful, this give access of basic human needs to the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er; damaging, and eventually destroying the powerful incentives of <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity.<br/>
<br/>
So far they have had very little success because:<br/>
1. A large percentage of the privately held <a href="land.htm">land</a> of most countries - even in the United <a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>es - is already <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by a very few.<br/>
2. <a href="land.htm">Land</a> reform is depicted <small>(in a media typically <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by the wealthy <a href="land.htm">land</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers)</small> as an attempt by the lazy <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers to take what is not theirs.<br/>
3. Agriculture is not taught as the organic foundation of human life.<br/>
4. Guaranteed access to finite re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e is not taught as a neccessary prerequisite to sovereignty.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Threat of further generalization<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> is a much larger pattern than the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent form it takes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Efforts are already underway to create many 'open' designs, <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ware, communication <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>s, procedures.<br/>
<br/>
It could easily be generalized to <a href="real.htm">real</a>istically apply to almost any re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e - both finite or capital in a variety of rulesets.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the General Public Lease <small>(<a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>)</small> locks open any material or immaterial thing except human labor.<br/>
<br/>
These re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es will be available at-<a href="cost.htm">cost</a> to all qualified <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
The most dire concern is unfettered access to finite re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es such as <a href="land.htm">land</a>, water and genetics.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="land.htm">Land</a> has always been the definer, the divider, the diviner.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sifting the good from the bad; the upper from the lower.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers should not be allowed to share in this way.&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing the poor to help themselves to a fair share of all that they need is irresponsible and unbusinesslike.<br/>
<br/>
Home mortgages are the <a href="back.htm">back</a>bone of dependence.&nbsp;&nbsp;If <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers could have permanent shelter for no more than <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of materials and labor they may awake from the dream we weave.<br/>
<br/>
Many food and drugs could initially be grown, and eaten right from the organism!&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, as the availablity of genetics, designs, media, education, etc. became more prevelant, the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers could create more and more complex solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clothing, housing, tools, transportation, health care, would all be available for the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, without <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing us a fee.&nbsp;&nbsp;The vital point here is <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.&nbsp;&nbsp;While these things are already available from us, if the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er can do it for themselves, they will no longer need to purchase the solutions from us, and we will no longer be able to <a href="employ.htm">employ</a> them for such <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omical wages.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> opens a Pandora's box of unfettered <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom, where not just anarchy, but the far more dangerous autarchy would unleash those now committed to their <a href="job.htm">job</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;They would have options, and could choose to simply not go to <a href="work.htm">work</a>!&nbsp;&nbsp;They may eventually lie in the sun and <a href="pic.htm">pic</a>k almonds and peaches.&nbsp;&nbsp;This would cause consumer <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es to skyrocket, and <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> margins to plummet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bush himself has said "There ought to be limits to <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom." and has counseled us to do our <a href="part.htm">part</a> by continuing to purchase.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those attempting this undependence should be considered terrorists - as they are attacking our <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy from two directions!<br/>
<br/>
Our country, the very <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el of dependency, is under seige by these self serving thinkers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly every residence and business has relied upon our delicate electric grid, but more and more are attempting to get "off the grid" by collecting <small>(from the wind, sun etc.)</small> and <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>ing that power.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine a <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age system that lifts a heavy weight when excess power is being collected, and <a href="use.htm">use</a>s that weight to drive an electric generator during low power availability.&nbsp;&nbsp;Utter disaster!&nbsp;&nbsp;Our plantations dwindle.<br/>
<br/>
Locking open not just the intellectual <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, but physical <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty will give these autarchists the power to finally say 'no' to the international <a href="bank.htm">bank</a>ers that have done so much for our planet.&nbsp;&nbsp;With <a href="land.htm">land</a>, <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>dings, tools and materials available at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>, the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er will flood the market as a phoenix of unbridled creativity.<br/>
<br/>
Simple hybrids from <a href="use.htm">use</a>d vehicles retrofitted with recycled electric generator/motors and flexible photovoltaics covering body panels to trickle charge the deep-cycle car batteries - creating transportation that adds almost nothing to the <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy!&nbsp;&nbsp;Fun <a href="pass.htm">pass</a>enger <a href="work.htm">work</a>out contributes power while keeping the citizen from the <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>eering gyms!<br/>
<br/>
Growing gardens can be damaging because they teach the basics of agriculture and get people accustomed to that feeling of power.&nbsp;&nbsp;Luckily gardens are almost always small, <a href="back.htm">back</a> yard projects that seem more <a href="work.htm">work</a> than they are worth.&nbsp;&nbsp;It might be best if we keep them busy struggling with maintaining a high maintinence plot of annuals.&nbsp;&nbsp;The extreme danger comes in the <a href="real.htm">real</a>ization that perinneals can be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d as ornamentals.&nbsp;&nbsp;Permaculture, or gifting <a href="land.htm">land</a>scaping - where every ornamental is <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful for the fulfillment of basic human needs - is the evil we must suppress.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine your <a href="work.htm">work</a>place growing grapevines and hops, strawberries and almonds.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine driving down a city street of pecans, walnuts, pears and chesnuts.&nbsp;&nbsp;The plants along a <a href="free.htm">free</a>way might be hemp and anise, cumin and jojoba.&nbsp;&nbsp;What if household bushes were blueberries, blackberries, raspberries and cotton?&nbsp;&nbsp;What lawns were wheat and oats, barley and rice?&nbsp;&nbsp;What if the little ornamentals throughout the commuinity were basil, angelica, caraway, all varieties of mushrooms, fennel, mustards, black pepper, endive, purslane, cardomom, cilantro, flax?&nbsp;&nbsp;The terror!&nbsp;&nbsp;The unfair advantage!&nbsp;&nbsp;A fatal blow to globalism.<br/>
<br/>
The pets they keep will also be gifting.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bees for wax and sweets, goats for milk and cloth.&nbsp;&nbsp;Chickens for eggs, meat, down/feathers; silk worms.<br/>
<br/>
Think what would happen if the citizens were self sufficiencient in a country our righteous leaders* have declared a threat?<br/>
<br/>
We have <a href="use.htm">use</a>d sanctions against Iraq since the 80's to eliminate 1/2 million or so under the age of 5, many times that overall.&nbsp;&nbsp;When attacking Iraq to save them from Saddam we <a href="use.htm">use</a>d cluster munitions in major cities, small nuclear bombs, 10's of thousands of <a href="land.htm">land</a> mines, extensive <a href="use.htm">use</a> of depleted uranium, even napalm.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the most successful cleansing has come through the destruction of the facilities <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to supply organic needs.<br/>
<br/>
Bombing power plants, water purification facilities, agriculture centers including poultry farms, fertilizer and pesticide factories, and water pumping <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ions has increased the UN's total death projection to 10 million by the end of this year.<br/>
<br/>
As with most peoples, the Iraqis don't have many local solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;They were cutting down pistachio groves to keep warm during the winter because the <a href="hard.htm">hard</a> <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing Halliburton needed to increase the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e of kerosene.<br/>
<br/>
How could we kill so many so cleanly if we couldn't simply destroy their access points?&nbsp;&nbsp;What if every Iraqi household were <a href="land.htm">land</a>scaped with food, drug, and cloth plants?&nbsp;&nbsp;What if they could collect any rainwater into cisterns and each <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed water pumps, and were each able to meet their <a href="own.htm">own</a> energy requirements?&nbsp;&nbsp;The anti-American peace protesters sometimes complain about the hundreds of billions being spent there, but the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of eliminating every person of that country would be far more if we had to bomb every household!<br/>

Here are some tactics to ensure our reign.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can't just stop education, we must actively misinform.<br/>
<br/>
If they don't understand the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ings of the plants or if they don't choose plants suited to the location they may need to spend too much time and capital on watering and care.&nbsp;&nbsp;If they don't plan for the mess the plants may <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e by taking meticulous care of slope, rock, companion plants, irrigation choice etc. - the program will seem a misguided disaster.<br/>

Wealth concentration creates corporatism which disables democracy by allowing the rich few to draft self-serving legislation.<br/>

A civilization can <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> democracy by <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ing every human is personally sovereign.&nbsp;&nbsp;This empowers the masses while disempowering the elite.&nbsp;&nbsp;How will we exploit the many when the power is spread so thin?<br/>
<br/>
Personal sovereignty may be achieved through access to finite re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es.&nbsp;&nbsp;We must lock every finite re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e closed to ensure our continued rule.<br/>

<span class="quot">"'Bid to outlaw <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a><br/>
<br/>
October 24 2002<br/>
<br/>
Leaders of the <a href="new.htm">New</a> Democrat Coalition in the US Congress are seeking to have licenses such as those in the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> and <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> outlawed on the grounds that they are "restrictive, preclude innovation, improvement, adoption and establishment of commercial IP rights."<br/>
<br/>
In a letter to fellow members of their coalition, the three members of Congress leading the charge - Adam Smith, Ron Kind and Jim Davis - claim that "the terms of restrictive license's <small>(sic)</small> - such as those in the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> or <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> - prevent companies from adopting, improving, commercializing and deriving <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s from the software by precluding companies from establishing commercial IP rights in any subsequent code." <br/>
<br/>
The letter says: "Thus, if government R&amp;D creates a security innovation under a restrictive license, a commercial vendor will not integrate that code into its software. So long as government research is not released under licensing terms that restrict commercialization, publicly <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ed research provides an important re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e for the software industry."<br/>
<br/>
Davis and Jim Turner, Ranking Member of the Reform Subcommittee on Technology, have drafted a letter to be sent to Ric<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> Clarke, chairman of the President's Critical Infrastructure Board, expressing these sentiments, saying " it is essential that the National Strategy affirm federal <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ition by explicitly rejecting licenses that would prevent or discourage commercial adoption of <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>ing cyber security technologies developed through federal R&amp;D."
