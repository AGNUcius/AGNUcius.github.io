<span class="quot">> the purpose of killing off competition, i.e. dumping below <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.</span><br/>
<br/>
Dumping is only a problem for <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers who intend to keep <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional approach to Capitalistic <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion. But Capitalism is not the only way we might organize.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> seems to be necessary because that is what we <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itionally <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>e as a 'return' for initial investments.<br/>
<br/>
But there is another way, where the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is NOT sold after <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, but is instead already <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by those intending to <a href="use.htm">use</a> it.<br/>
<br/>
There is a special case of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership where <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> is not only unsought, but is strangely undefined!<br/>
<br/>
When the initial inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s <small>(and therefore <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers)</small> of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion are ALSO the very consumers of the output of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <small>(the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t)</small>, then <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" as a sort of side-effect of that <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
I see that you have a plan to set the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e of each <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t that comes from any organization choosing to operate in your special manner, and maybe there is some merit to that.<br/>
<br/>
But I want to stress that you may be overlooking the self-balancing solution I describe as "treat <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> as an investment from <small>(he paid it)</small> and for <small>(he will be the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of those <a href="new.htm">new</a> assets)</small> the very consumer who made that overpayment toward more Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion".<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> The only way for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e a <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>, under the <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el</span><br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is not a prerequisite to <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion when the collective Consumers are the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s and full <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers of those Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
This is not to imply that each Consumer must necessarily <a href="work.htm">Work</a> in all those industries he would have <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership in.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h2">== For example:</span><br/>
If you and I and 998 other people decide we want organic, whole, raw milk, we could get together and buy a dairy.<br/>
<br/>
We would each <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e an initial investment based upon how much we each intend <small>(what we each forecast)</small> that we will consume.<br/>
<br/>
We would pool some of those initial investments to buy some <a href="land.htm">land</a>, water rights, <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>ing cattle, feed, tools, etc.<br/>
<br/>
We would also need to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> some <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>ed <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers to tend and milk those animals, and there are some re<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ing <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s that we would each need to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> periodically.<br/>
<br/>
That sounds like alot of <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing, but it's easy to prove that a business organized in this way is cheaper for the Consumer when we consider a Capitalist dairy farmer must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> those exact same <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
All <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s must necessarily be "<a href="pass.htm">pass</a>ed on" to the Consumer <small>(the Consumer finally <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s for all <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion)</small> for that farmer to remain in business, but what we somehow overlook is that the farmer is also intending to charge a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e ABOVE that <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> - so he can '<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>' from his "exchange value" based venture.<br/>
<br/>
When the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t Consumers are the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers, then there is no reason to sell the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t after it is made, for it is already in the hands of those intending to <a href="use.htm">use</a> it.<br/>
<br/>
Each Consuming <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er would not 'buy' the milk after it was made, they would simply go to the <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>ehouse and <a href="pic.htm">pic</a>kup what they already <a href="own.htm">OWN</a>. They each <a href="own.htm">own</a> the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t they need when they each <a href="own.htm">own</a> "just the right a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a>" of Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es required for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, and when they are willing to continue to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the re<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ing <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Patrick<br/>
