<hr/><span class="date">Sep-29-2009:</span> What is wrong with US?&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do "We the People" fail to achieve our potential?<br/>
<br/>
Why do we have so much trouble organizing the <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es for our <a href="own.htm">own</a> benefit?<br/>
<br/>
Why do we assume, and therefore tend to structure those endeavors as lossy value sinks that require continual external <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing?<br/>
<br/>
Where is the abundance?&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom?&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the fun?<br/>

<hr/><span class="date">Sep-28-2009:</span> Some terminology that has shaped our perception toward the role of consumer:<br/>
----<br/>
<span class="quot">"'client&nbsp;&nbsp;1393, from Anglo-Fr. clyent, from L. cliens <small>(acc. clientem)</small> "follower, retainer," perhaps a var. of prp. of cluere "listen, follow, obey" <small>(see listen)</small>; or from clinare "to incline, bend," from suffixed form of PIE base *klei- "to lean" <small>(see lean <small>(v.)</small>)</small>. The ground sense is of one who leans on another for <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ion. In ancient Rome, a plebian under <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ion of a patrician <small>(in this relationship called patronus, see patron)</small>, originally in Eng. "a lawyer's customer," by c.1600 extended to any customer. Clientele is 1563, from Fr. clientèle, from L. clientela "relationship between dependent and patron." '"</span> -- <a class="ext" href="http://EtymOnline.com">EtymOnline.com</a><br/>
<br/>
Here the role is clearly subservient to the 'server' <small>(as in client/server architecture)</small>.<br/>
----<br/>
<span class="quot">"'patron "a lord-master, a <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>or," c.1300, from <a class="ext" href="http://O.Fr.">O.Fr.</a> patrun <small>(12c.)</small>, from M.L. patronus "patron saint, bestower of a benefice, lord, master, <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el, pattern," from L. patronus "defender, <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>or, advocate," from pater <small>(gen. patris)</small> "father." Meaning "one who advances the cause" <small>(of an <a href="art.htm">art</a>ist, institution, etc.)</small>, usually by the person's wealth and power, is attested from 1377; "commonly a wretch who supports with insolence, and is paid with flattery" <small>[Johnson]</small>. Commercial sense of "regular customer" first recorded 1605.'"</span> -- <a class="ext" href="http://EtymOnline.com">EtymOnline.com</a><br/>
<br/>
This seems to show the role of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership being separated from and then finally replaced by the role of consumer.<br/>
<br/>
The "regular customer" <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a mixes the need to compensate for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion with the <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> paid to <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally, a patron as "lord-master" might support an <a href="art.htm">art</a>isan by <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing for the material <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and would also probably supply a sort of "basic income" directly through housing and basic sustenance, but would certainly not be <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
----<br/>
<span class="quot">"'chap <small>(n.)</small> 1577, "customer," short for obsolete chapman <small>(see cheap)</small>. Colloquial sense of "lad, fellow" is first attested 1716 <small>(cf. slang tough customer)</small>.'"</span> -- <a class="ext" href="http://EtymOnline.com">EtymOnline.com</a><br/>
<br/>
We commonly assume and usually accept the consumer to be unprepared - <a href="part.htm">part</a>ially because of his immaturity.<br/>

When I say 'instantiate' I am talking about "creating a physical instance of some design".<br/>
<br/>
You say "I do designs".&nbsp;&nbsp;But that is NOT the same as instantiation. You are talking about only the design half.<br/>
<br/>
Would you say the design of a car is the same as a car?<br/>
<br/>
Can you drive a design down the road?<br/>
<br/>
Instantiating a car requires <small>(typically)</small> various metals, plastic, rubber, grease, many tools, <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>dings to house those things and <a href="land.htm">land</a> for those things to reside.<br/>

I avoid manufacturing because I don't have access to the <a href="land.htm">Land</a>, Tools, heavy <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hinery, etc. *required* to manufacture.<br/>
<br/>
But since those things are tremendously expensive, and since - even if I could afford them, I could never *utilize* them to their full potential, we <small>(the people)</small> are in need of a way to <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> those expensive things.<br/>
<br/>
The adhe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>s of Open Manufacturing seem to <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently care nothing about <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership, but instead, if local instantiation is attempted at all, it is through singly-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ed and mostly toy-like "desktop manufacturing" such as reprap, etc.<br/>

<a href="co-own.htm">Co-own</a>ership is <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult, but until we face that trouble we will be only designers because we will lack "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" access to the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es required for material instantiation.<br/>

<br/>
Are you saying growth has limits?&nbsp;&nbsp;If so, then I <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>.<br/>
<br/>
But that is not why we lack abundant fish.<br/>
<br/>
The reason is caused by governments run by corporations steered by <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> which requires scarcity.<br/>
<br/>
We could easily farm enough fish to feed everyone in the world many times over if we knew how to <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> <small>(share or multiplex)</small> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
But the corporations that do <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>, do so in a very centeralized manner caused by their mistreating <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as though it were a reward for them to keep.<br/>
<br/>
They operate the governments directly, and those governments create legislation <small>(such as the US Farm Bill)</small> that <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificially keeps <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> by purposefully decreasing abundance by <small>(for instance)</small> <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing farmers to NOT grow on <a href="land.htm">land</a> that is provably arable.<br/>
<br/>
We cannot solve or even address this issue until we <a href="real.htm">real</a>ize and admit that the Material Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <small>(Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es)</small> must be in the hands of those that intend to <a href="use.htm">use</a> the outputs of those Means.<br/>
<br/>
I'm talking about the consumers that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t now will in the future organize to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion - and at that time, when the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ers are the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, and when <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is being treated as an investment from he who paid it, those organizations will not have the filthy goal of withholding abundance to <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>-up <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e, for their goal will be *<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t* instead.<br/>

Fabricate?&nbsp;&nbsp;What the hell does that mean?&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't have access to the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es required for fabrication!<br/>
<br/>
How are we, the people supposed to fabricate without <a href="land.htm">land</a>, <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>dings, tools, etc.?&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the question the <a href="art.htm">art</a>icle is asking.<br/>
<br/>
How can you <small>(and so many others on these lists)</small> so readily brush aside the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>iculty of *instantiating* these designs?<br/>
<br/>
We, the people do not have the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es required for 'fabrication'.<br/>
<br/>
Sure design is important.&nbsp;&nbsp;But that is only a <small>(very small)</small> <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the problem.<br/>
<br/>
The complexity of designing a bicycle is on the verge of trivial.<br/>
<br/>
The primary <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>iculty is access to the mass, time, <a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e and energy required to 'host' that design in physical <a href="real.htm">real</a>ity.<br/>
<br/>
Most people on these lists seem to think we will fix this in the future through rep-rap robots.&nbsp;&nbsp;Quit dreaming.<br/>
<br/>
We can address this *now* with <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent technology by "getting together" and <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ing those Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es for the purpose of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t instead of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
But such an approach has a massive psychological barrier: we have been convinced/hypnotized into believing <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion cannot occur unless <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is treated as a reward for those that organize.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually we will see that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t alone <small>(in this case bicycles)</small> is enough of a reason for we, the people to *<a href="own.htm">own</a>* Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <small>(such as the <a href="land.htm">land</a>, <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>dings and tools needed to <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d bicycles)</small> needed for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, but until then we will ignorantly beg those that intend to charge us a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s <small>(the Capitalist <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>eers)</small> to "do the right thing" when they have a big reason not to: for <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> decreases as abundance increases, so it is clear they will never do *our* will, for to do so would put them out of the business of keeping us dependent upon them!<br/>

<br/>
Your wording seems to convey a slightly incorrect interpretation of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>'s constraints.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> only requires <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es be made available to those who receive the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no overarching requirement to publish those changes <a href="back.htm">back</a> to "the commons", nor is there any requirement to notify the original copyright holders in any way.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, according to the FSF, any license with those requirements does not even qualify as a "<a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software" license!<br/>
<br/>
So, for example, let's say Google <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ifies the Linux kernel <small>(which is of course <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ed by the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>)</small> and <a href="use.htm">use</a>s that <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified version to run it's servers.<br/>
<br/>
Google is not required to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e those changes public unless <small>(and only to whomever)</small> they publish the binaries.<br/>
<br/>
So Google could sell their <a href="new.htm">new</a> binaries <small>(say to Yahoo)</small> even for a very large a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> - there is no limit - but the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e-code must accompany the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect <a href="file.htm">file</a>s <small>(the executable binaries)</small> during that transaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still no requirement to publish anything to the public in general.<br/>
<br/>
It is a common and very deep mistake to conflate "<a href="free.htm">Free</a> as in <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom" with zero <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a subtle point but very applicable to your quest since the ability to withhold <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>ed binaries until <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment is received is a completely legal and in fact very important <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the hi<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>y of this license.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="rms.htm">RMS</a> <a href="use.htm">use</a>d this feature of the license to get paid while developing <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="emacs.htm">Emacs</a> by charging $150.00 for each copy he distributed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="http://GNU.org/bulletins/bull2.txt">http://GNU.org/bulletins/bull2.txt</a> - notice he was distributing the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e-code by itself, not the binaries at all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> Is there a license out there that prevents contamination?</span><br/>
<br/>
If you do not want to be 'contaminated', then just write your <a href="own.htm">own</a> damn code.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you feel you should be able to do anything you want with the Copyrighted <a href="work.htm">work</a> of others?<br/>
<br/>
What strange logic people <a href="use.htm">use</a> against the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I took a Microsoft EULAed binary and <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified it <small>(<a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult without <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e-code, but not impossible)</small> and then wanted to distribute the <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified whole as my <a href="own.htm">own</a> while complaining my project had been contaminated/infected, there would be few that thought my stance was sane.<br/>
<br/>
Yet a surprisingly large number of humans support breaking the requirements of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> even though in both cases these are simply Copyright licenses.<br/>
<br/>
From where does this belief arise that the Copyright holders deserve no respect when the license is not <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>rietary?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> And has</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> that license generated successful <a href="ecos.htm">ecos</a>ystems/projects with open</span><br/>
