<br/>
<span class="quot">> Because I love God</span><br/>
<br/>
But which God do you mean?<br/>
<br/>
If you say "It doesn't matter" then why should anyone believe in ANY God when the claims each of these <a href="imag.htm">imag</a>inary beings <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es <small>(through the scripture of each religion)</small> conflict with the others in mutually exclusive ways?<br/>
<br/>
For instance, the Jewish faith and Chrisitanity cannot be simultaneously correct since one says "Jesus is NOT the Christ", while the other says "HE IS".<br/>
<br/>
Religion is a bacteria that you must purge from your brain in order to more clearly understand why corporations puppeteer politicians toward goals that are generally bad for the <a href="pop.htm">pop</a>ulace.<br/>
<br/>
If you say "Well, I mean Jesus Christ of course", then maybe you should watch all of the <a class="ext" href="http://ZeitgeistMovie.com">http://ZeitgeistMovie.com</a> of which you sent clips of the other day <small>[ entire film available at <a class="ext" href="http://Video.Google.com/videoplay?docid=5547481422995115331">http://Video.Google.com/videoplay?docid=5547481422995115331</a> ]</small><br/>

You may love <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom, but "Terrorists hate <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom"<small>(TM)</small> - where the terrorists are the corporations <small>(think of these as the many-headed 'Beast' in Revelations if you like)</small> who's <a href="profit.htm">PROFIT</a>S would fail <small>(<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e would meet <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>)</small> if citizens/consumers were to be the <a href="own.htm">OWN</a>ERS of the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <small>(the factories and farms)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Marx and his follwers was/are wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Consumers, NOT the <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers who must be the <a href="own.htm">OWN</a>ERS.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are thinking "Blah, blah, who cares about the details of <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omics?", then it is <a href="part.htm">part</a>ially because you have not looked at this long enough, and also <a href="part.htm">part</a>ially because you are falling into the trap set by these feudalists to confuse your brain with devisive religions.<br/>

This film dusts the surface.<br/>
<br/>
Could you please tell me <small>(while avoiding the intellecutal laziness of labeling somebody 'evil')</small> why corporations operate in this manner?<br/>
<br/>
Why is <small>[so-called <a href="free.htm">Free</a>]</small> <a href="trad.htm">TRAD</a>E so important?&nbsp;&nbsp;It is mentioned many times in the film.<br/>
<br/>
Why can't the people of this nation grow their <a href="own.htm">own</a> pine nuts and mandrin oranges?&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does China <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e almost *everything* we consume?<br/>
<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion is a military stance that we have been fooled into moving away from, but how did this happen?<br/>
<br/>
What is <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>?&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you <a href="real.htm">real</a>ize the For-<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> corporations that run almost every government fail BY DEFINITION when Consumer <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e meets <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>?&nbsp;&nbsp;Poverty is prerequisite to <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
We <small>(the taxpayers)</small> <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> so-called farmers <small>(often celebrities and sport stars who have ag investments)</small> to NOT grow within our borders.&nbsp;&nbsp;We <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for that <a href="land.htm">land</a> to sit idle so <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e doesn't fall to <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> - for to do so would put all farmers <small>(and any business)</small> "out of business" because of the faulty notion that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is a reward to be won against the rest of humanity!<br/>
<br/>
Are we insane?&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is the answer?&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the answer, but you will not hear me when I tell you "<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> must be treated as an investment from the consumer who paid it so that <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e approaches <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> and <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> approaches zero in a safe manner."<br/>
<br/>
I think Ron Paul has good intentions, and will likely vote for him, but even if he isn't removed by those who removed JFK and brought down WTC 1,2 and 7, he won't be able to solve the problem of <a href="trad.htm">TRAD</a>E unless the root problem of Usury <small>(the mistreatment of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> is recognized and acted upon.<br/>

Hello Christian and everyone.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> Christian Siefkes wrote:</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> The first characteristic of peer <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is that the effort required to</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> reach the goals of a project is shared among those who care enough to</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> contribute.</span><br/>
<br/>
Would you say this set of people you describe also happens to be the same set <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itionally called 'consumers' or '<a href="user.htm">user</a>s' of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t?<br/>
<br/>
I understand you want all of these consumers to simultaneously be <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers in that exact industry <small>(operating the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es required for that exact <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion)</small>, but is there any case where they would not be consumers of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t?<br/>
<br/>
If some of these people are ever not consumers <small>(<a href="user.htm">user</a>s)</small> of those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts, then why would those people ever choose to <a href="work.htm">work</a>?<br/>
<br/>
If all of these people are consumers <small>(<a href="user.htm">user</a>s)</small>, then what you are describing happens to be a "<a href="user own.htm">User Own</a>ed" organization; though your requirement that every consumer also be a <a href="work.htm">work</a>er in that exact industry also <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es it "<a href="work.htm">Work</a>er <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ed"...<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> Everybody who wants to benefit from the project <small>(to get a bike)</small> might thus be</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> expected to _contribute some effort_ to the project</span><br/>
<br/>
So you want every consumer to be a <a href="work.htm">work</a>er in that exact industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not trying to be a thorn, but I just don't understand why we would want to stop these consumers from using a <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency to <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e labor.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> will end up with a lower labor weight <small>(say, 0.5)</small>, while an unpopular task</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> <small>(say, garbage removal)</small> will end up with a high labor weight <small>(say, 2.0)</small>.</span><br/>
<br/>
Yes, what you say <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es sense, but wouldn't it <a href="work.htm">work</a> just as well if each of these <a href="user.htm">user</a>s <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed percentages in each industry <small>(such as garbage collection and recycling)</small> in just the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> that they need for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, so they were mostly not <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ing *goods* <small>(since the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of an apple tree <a href="own.htm">own</a>s the apples even before they are <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed, even if he happened to hire some <small>(<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing a wage as a <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion)</small> to <a href="pic.htm">pic</a>k them)</small>, but were also allowed to <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e *labor* by <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing each other with tokens - so as to avoid needing to switch <a href="job.htm">job</a>s and travel so much etc.?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> All who want just a single bicycle contribute roughly the same</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> effort <small>(as in the flat rate <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el)</small>, but those who want _two_ bicycles now</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> have to contribute twice as much, and so on.</span><br/>
<br/>
So the consumer "<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e" is twice as high for 2 bikes.&nbsp;&nbsp;That sounds fine, but is this <small>(one <a href="part.htm">part</a> of your whole system)</small> any <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> from what we see today?<br/>
<br/>
I understand the Debt-Based <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency we <a href="use.htm">use</a> today <small>(such as the Federal Reserve <a href="note.htm">Note</a>)</small> has terrible problems, but wouldn't it be ok if we made an 'internal', local <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency or cr<a href="edit.htm">edit</a>/point system to ease the <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ing of *labor*?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> If there is more demand for a <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t than</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> can be satisfied, the peer project can thus "auction" the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t: it can</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> raise the relative _<a href="cost.htm">cost</a>_ <small>(the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of required contributions)</small> of the</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t until sufficiently many of the prospective <a href="user.htm">user</a>s get s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>d</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> thoughts. I call this the _preference weighting_ <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el since the</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> preferences of people regarding the goods they want to get are "weighted"</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> <small>(similar to the "weighting" of <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> tasks in the _weighted labor_</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el discussed above)</small>.</span><br/>
<br/>
This also sounds the same as letting the 'market' take care of _this portion_ of the system.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> in a <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> way--those who get an auctioned good will have to contribute</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> more, while those who want other goods <small>(which can be <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed in sufficient</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> quantity)</small> will all have to contribute less.</span><br/>
<br/>
And that is also what we see today using the market and regular <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y, right?<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> It is important to understand that no _exchange_ takes place between those</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> who <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e a good and those who <a href="use.htm">use</a> it: increasing the _<a href="cost.htm">cost</a>_ <small>(expected</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> contributions)</small> of a good won't increase it's _<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion effort_, and it is</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion effort which the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers get recognized as contributions.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> If there was exchange, a higher <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> for the consumers would go <small>(wholly or</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> in <a href="part.htm">part</a>)</small> to the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ers, but this is not the case.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">></span><br/>
<br/>
This is a very important point, but it is from the fact that the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers are also the Consumers that exchange of *goods* need not take place<small>(1)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Allowing the exchange of *labor* is not something we need to avoid as long as the Consumers are the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of the means of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <small>(<a href="user own.htm">User Own</a>ed)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<small>(1)</small> We could still allow the exchange of goods, and this would be important for newcomers <small>(johnny come latelys)</small>, but in order to hold the system in place we would just need to treat any <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> <small>(<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>)</small> as an investment from the consumer <small>(<a href="user.htm">user</a>)</small> that paid it to help them <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>dup their <a href="own.htm">own</a> percentage of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in each industry of that community.<br/>
<br/>
Hoping we can <a href="work.htm">work</a> together to figure this out,<br/>

<br/>
I am very interested in what it will take to earn a wage from <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software for instance, and my general view is that developers must somehow get connected to the consumers <small>(<a href="user.htm">user</a>s)</small> who are willing to commit to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing for features *before* the <a href="work.htm">work</a> is performed.<br/>
<br/>
I envision this as bug/feature tracking software that helps <a href="user.htm">user</a>s easily add even a tiny "<a href="promis.htm">promis</a>e to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>" to cumulative bounties from within the application itself - as a kind of "complaint click" or "bitch button" that might even be integrated into the application 'frame' next to the <small>[minimize]</small> button...<br/>
<br/>
On the developer side, any <a href="work.htm">work</a>er could sort their view of the bounty list by reward size <small>(for instance)</small>, and probably choose to <a href="work.htm">work</a> on things they might have already wanted, but this also allows consumers to drive innovation without possessing the <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s themselves by contracting to reward <a href="art.htm">art</a>isans for accomplishing <a href="work.htm">work</a> that may otherwise never have incentive to accomplish.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the <a href="work.htm">work</a> conflicts with the goals of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er, the new version can be considered a fork and even be renamed if those consumers desire, or if the <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>emark holders demand.<br/>
<br/>
It will probably usually be best to define that fork as a "patch" against the main project <small>(think of the Linux kernel for instance)</small> - so that special version will always easily receive other general improvements to the mainline without much fuss...<br/>
<br/>
For other <a href="art.htm">art</a>, the <a href="art.htm">art</a>ists should also plan to get paid *before* the performance by selling tickets to limited seating during the recording or filming, but this will require the consumers <a href="own.htm">own</a> the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es <small>(<a href="land.htm">land</a>, studio, <a href="cam.htm">cam</a>eras, <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>umes, etc.)</small> to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e it efficient - otherwise the externality called <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> will leak most of the value away from the community.<br/>

A movie is obviously non-rivalrous in that the number of potential copies is infinite, but it is also constrained by the rivalrous <a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e, time, mass and energy required to create, <a href="use.htm">use</a>, <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify, copy and share it.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is common to brush off these hosting <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s as being 'marginal', but if they are so unimportant, why don't we just <a href="start.htm">start</a> a video hosting site today to replace YouTube?&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly pretend the warehouses of servers Google <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s for are not physical constraints?&nbsp;&nbsp;And it doesn't end there.&nbsp;&nbsp;That movie cannot be utilized unless it is copied, which of course takes time, and consumes physical re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es including the twisted-copper, fiber optics or satellite <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ware <small>(mass)</small> to transmit it, and a local <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter <small>(more mass)</small> and electricity <small>(energy)</small> and even <a href="land.htm">land</a> <small>(<a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e)</small> to house these things.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, once the mechanical design of a washing <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine <small>(the type)</small> has been created by an engineer, what are the potential number of washing <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hines <small>(instances)</small> that can be <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed <small>(how many times may it be copied)</small>?&nbsp;&nbsp;The design is just as infinite in potential <small>(non-rivalrous)</small> as the movie, yet is also constrained by <a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e, time, mass and energy again.<br/>
<br/>
Wheat is actually just a design <small>(DNA or genetics)</small> that has been 'applied' to the Mass called 'dust' or 'clay' or 'sand', and the Mass called 'water' using a little bit of <a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e <small>(<a href="land.htm">land</a>)</small> and some SUN for energy.&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer and breadmaker apply their <a href="own.htm">own</a> designs as they harvest, thresh, grind, mix, knead, bake and cut to specialize that mass into a finished <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
But software also requires Mass for <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age <small>(a <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>-drive, CD, DVD, RAM, even paper or your brain if you have not yet entered it into a <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter)</small> and a physical input device <small>(such as a <a href="key.htm">key</a>board or microphone)</small> for creation and an output device <small>(such as a <a href="moni.htm">moni</a>tor or speakers)</small> for "expression".&nbsp;&nbsp;This Mass also requires it's <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="spac.htm">Spac</a>e to exist and of course software has little value if it can't be "expressed" by temporarily applying that design to a completed <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter components using electricity for energy.<br/>
<br/>
While the time and personal energy <small>(labor)</small> needed to copy a grain of wheat appears to be much more than downloading a copy of a program and running it, if we factor in all the re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es required to manufacture the <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ware and supply the electricity as compared to allowing nature to <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agate the seed, it may not be as much of a <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence as we <a href="imag.htm">imag</a>ine.<br/>
<br/>
In summary, even though <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> TYPES of things require <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> A<a href="mount.htm">MOUNT</a>S of physical re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es for their <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, the fact remains that all things have infinite potential, and all things are <a href="real.htm">real</a>istically constrained by <a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e, time, mass and energy.<br/>

<br/>
Decreasing <a href="work.htm">work</a> through automation is dangerous except when the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t consumers <small>(whether of software or of bread or of cars)</small> are the *<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers* of the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <small>(the <a href="land.htm">land</a> and capital)</small> required for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">"'Automation is the <a href="key.htm">key</a> to reduce the factor of labor drastically, to embed <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion in units of the right size to establish a circular exchange.'"</span><br/>
<br/>
Fabbers may seem amazing, but they will not solve the problems we face.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have always had slow-motion, self-re<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing Fabbers that require only <a href="land.htm">land</a> <small>(surface area)</small>, soil, water, sun and the rotting material of previous such Fabbers to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e the raw materials of food, cloth, <a href="soap.htm">soap</a>, ointments, fuel and many <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>ding materials, yet so many on earth go without these necessities for other reasons.<br/>
<br/>
One reason is that while collective <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership has great advantages over purely individual action, the organizations that are created for that complicated <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion tend to NOT distribute the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of the investments they <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e in more physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es as that community grows.&nbsp;&nbsp;This causes democracy to become less and less direct.<br/>
<br/>
It is good to treat <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as an investment in future <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, but the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of that <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty should eventually come under the control of <small>(should vest to)</small> the very consumer who paid it.&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, "<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" <small>(<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> is a plea for growth, and must be respected as such for a system to scale.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership of new investments is not <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently distributed because to do so would hamper the <small>(unfortunate)</small> goal of Capitalist <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers to keep consumer <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s in the name of *<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>*, or <small>(in the case of non-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> corps.)</small>, to retain <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership for the purpose of keeping the wage paid <small>(say to the board-member of a non-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> hospital)</small> <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificially inflated - essentially absorbing what would otherwise have been labeled '<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>'.<br/>
<br/>
If all <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ment within an organization were truly available for reverse-bid on the open market, then the 'overpaid' CEO would never be safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;This can happen when each <a href="user.htm">user</a> of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is also a <a href="part.htm">part</a>ial joint <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of the <a href="land.htm">land</a> and capital <small>(physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es)</small> needed in predicted a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> required for the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of that specific <a href="user.htm">user</a>'s future demands <small>(needs and wants)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
All industry require material <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion already.&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither genetics nor software, nor mechanical design <small>(such as of a car)</small> can be utilized without <a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e, time, mass and energy to *host* that information.<br/>
<br/>
Videos from Google and <a href="spac.htm">spac</a>es they call 'My' may *seem* <a href="free.htm">free</a> as in beer, but the arbitrary restrictions and requirements are already above the <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="buil.htm">Buil</a>ding washing <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hines <small>(<a class="ext" href="http://Second.Oekonux-Conference.org/documentation/texts/Seaman.html">Second.Oekonux-Conference.org/documentation/texts/Seaman.html</a>)</small> is just as <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>ly as social <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>ing.&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is not solved for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts with infinite potential <small>(software, genetics, mechanical design, music, video, etc.)</small> because all of these require <a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e, time, material and energy to <a href="use.htm">use</a>, <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify, copy and share them.<br/>

<hr/><span class="date">Jan-07-2008:</span> Samuel Rose writes this list of questions and quotes of my answers<br/>
<br/>
Q: What is <a href="user own.htm">User own</a>ership, exactly?<br/>
A: "<a href="user own.htm">User Own</a>er" is an OpenBusinessModel that treats <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as incremental <a href="user.htm">User</a>Investment toward Physical<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es so each consumer slowly gains Controlling Shares of <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in that "For <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t" business whenever they <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q: Huh? "For <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t"?&nbsp;&nbsp;"<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e Above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>"?&nbsp;&nbsp;What are those?<br/>
A: A "For <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t" business is one in which the primary goal is <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t.&nbsp;&nbsp; A "For <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t" business can scale through a legally binding Social Contract that requires <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> be treated as <a href="user.htm">User</a> Investment.<br/>
<br/>
"<a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e Above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>" is another way of talking about <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, but also includes cases where wages are not fully competitive because the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers are acting as <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers who overpay themselves.<br/>
<br/>
In <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional Capitalism, a Consumer' <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment of <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e Above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> is collected by the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers of Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es and labled '<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>'.&nbsp;&nbsp;This <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e and <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> becomes the central goal, with the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t becoming incidental and eventually even a problem for those <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers if it solves or <a href="part.htm">part</a>ially solves the problem <small>(or 'need' or 'want')</small> that business is predicated upon.<br/>
<br/>
But a consumer's <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment of <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> is actually his plea for growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;He is admitting he can't meet that <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ective any other way because he doesn't <a href="own.htm">own</a> the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es needed for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that he <small>(the 'consumer' or '<a href="user.htm">user</a>')</small> be the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es even if he does not happen to have the <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s to operate them.&nbsp;&nbsp;In that case, he can offer that <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ment on the open market for qualified <a href="art.htm">art</a>isans looking for <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and will <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> those wages as a <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <small>(just as he already does when <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing for the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect he desires)</small>, but cannot <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> '<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>' unless he were to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> it to himself.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q: Ok, so basically, when people buy <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts from this type of business, they become shareholders - <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of a <a href="part.htm">part</a> of that company by <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing more for the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t than the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e, right?&nbsp;&nbsp;Each time they <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> "<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" that extra a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> is applied towards a share in the company for that consumer/<a href="user.htm">user</a>/customer, right?<br/>
A: Yes! Exactly!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q: So, what is the advantage to doing things this way?<br/>
A: The advantage is extremely low consumer <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;While <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s will actually be a bit higher at first since we won't yet have the efficiency of scale, as the consumers become the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e approaches <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> as <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> approaches ZERO.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the dynamic nature of consumers, the perfect case is usually only achieved for brief periods of time, but in that case, <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e equals <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> and <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> equals ZERO when an <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect <a href="user own.htm">User own</a>s just enough of the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es required for the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of their demands.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q: Won't this be <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult to govern? can average people be trusted to to <a href="own.htm">own</a> the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion?<br/>
A:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q: How will this affect our existing <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omies?<br/>
A:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q: How does US, or other law <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently apply to the <a href="user own.htm">User Own</a>er<br/>
arrangement?<br/>
A:<br/>
