&nbsp; Pantheism \Pan"the*ism\, n. <small>[Pan- + theism.]</small><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctrine that the universe, taken or conceived of as a<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;combined force and natural laws which are manifested in the<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;existing universe; cosmotheism. The doctrine denies that God<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Islam is an apastolic teaching, not one of redemption, therefore they are able to draw from our fold"<br/>

The etymology of the word 'lord' is "hlafweard" or "hla-f weard" which means "bread guard".<br/>

<br/>
What will happen as <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <small>(of all physical 'goods')</small> is more and more automated?<br/>
<br/>
Will it be good for the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers?&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm.. There will be less to do, so maybe we can relax...&nbsp;&nbsp;But there will be less <a href="work.htm">work</a> to choose from, so we will be paid less.<br/>
<br/>
You may say "People will just 'retool' to <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="job.htm">job</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;That's what progress is all about."&nbsp;&nbsp;But if that's the case, does that indicate our <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy "needs" problems so there is always plenty of "<a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ment"?<br/>

<span class="h4">====From a friend:</span><br/>
<br/>
I have been quite busy lately so it has taken me some time to reply.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is my negative input that you requested:<br/>
<br/>
- Rename communityism to something else - it sounds too much like communism, and that has such a negative connotation in people's minds that this could negatively affect the ability of people to even <a href="start.htm">start</a> to consider or accept your <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>as.&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be a dumb reason to reject your <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>as, but that is irrelevant.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Another serious barrier to people accepting what you are suggesting is that in a large <a href="part.htm">part</a> <small>(not completely though)</small>, people think that that have already tried what you are <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>osing - it's called "being a pioneer" and people will look at your <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>as about becoming self sufficient and think, "why would I want to be a pioneer again?"&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already tried that and found that life is more pleasant when we are a bit dependant upon each other - I'll keep my washing <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine and special detergent that <a href="work.htm">work</a>s well instead of this lye <a href="soap.htm">soap</a> I just made.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether this is a true or false assumption made by people is not the issue, the issue is that you need to sell people on why "pioneerism" will <a href="work.htm">work</a> this time around.&nbsp;&nbsp;If there <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly is a <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between your plan and just returning to be a bunch of 1800's pioneers, then you need to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e sure people understand the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence and the importance of that <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence - and this needs to be done up front.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- I think that comparing the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> and your <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>as based on the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> to "gifting" is very wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;A gift is a one-way transfer with absolutely no strings attached.&nbsp;&nbsp;Things given via the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> <small>(and your <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>as based on the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>)</small> are NOT gifts; they are a two-way transfer contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;The "<a href="user.htm">user</a>" gets a <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t or service and you get control of their future actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is no more a gift than <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>rietary software is.&nbsp;&nbsp;Public domain is gifting, for example.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even BSD is not gifting because you have to give cr<a href="edit.htm">edit</a>, right?&nbsp;&nbsp;P.S. Endlessly giving everything to the poor that they need only weakens them and <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es them more dependant.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see how the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> could also <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e people weaker and more dependant upon already written software.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure it's good to reuse, as long as you <a href="know.htm">know</a> you could write your <a href="own.htm">own</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows programmers, for example, have been considerably dumbed down because the OS takes care of so much for them that they couldn't do it for themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> could do the same for all of the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> code that already exists and people would just rely on it and never learn to do it for themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some of my <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>as that haven't completely formed, but it all has to do with gifting and the effects of too much gifting.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Fix the <a href="web.htm">web</a>site's hyperlinking of <a href="part.htm">part</a>ial words.&nbsp;&nbsp;This could prevent people from taking you seriously because the strange linking may distract or turn off your readers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep the linking, just fix it.<br/>
<br/>

<span class="h4">====From Patware:</span><br/>
Thank you this is very helpful.&nbsp;&nbsp;The psychological factor is definitely more powerful than I originally <a href="real.htm">real</a>ized.<br/>
<br/>
I <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> with most of what you say, and will <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e those changes and let you <a href="know.htm">know</a> when they are in place.<br/>

<span class="h4">====From a Friend:</span><br/>
PS: If we found out how much <a href="land.htm">land</a> it takes to be self sufficient, that much could be tax <a href="free.htm">free</a> and then a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a>s above that could have a geometrically increasing tax on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;This could curb hoarding <small>(this should apply to the government too of course)</small> while still allowing people to <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly <a href="own.htm">own</a> their <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="land.htm">land</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, "wicked" people would subvert that by splitting up the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership across many people, etc. but it might raise the bar.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h4">====From Patware:</span><br/>
Henry George's "single tax" is 'progressive' <small>(his term)</small> as you suggest - to penalize largest holders most.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose your s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>d point could be true, though I'm not sure why the "across many individuals" people you mention would not have access to their <a href="own.htm">own</a> fair a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of finite re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es ... after all, that is the whole point of writing a license = to restrict <small>(not a gift, I <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>)</small> our <a href="own.htm">own</a> selves <small>(the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers)</small> from ever hoarding in the future so that there will be enough for all <small>(within the physical limits of the planet, which we are nowhere near if we would begin acting responsibly)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
So if we write the license incorrectly <small>(most likely there will be bugs)</small>, there will be <a href="work.htm">work</a>arounds <small>(cracks)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
A very rough beginnings of my license at: <a class="ext" href="http://patware.freeshell.org/Sovereign%20Resource%20License.html">patware.freeshell.org/Sovereign%20Resource%20License.html</a><br/>
<br/>
We <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly need to write a simple video <a href="game.htm">game</a> - or even board <a href="game.htm">game</a> that helps us experiment with how such things would play out, especially when finite re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es are more truly scarce <small>(<a href="land.htm">land</a> on an is<a href="land.htm">land</a>, or water in a desert, etc.)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Another <a href="note.htm">note</a> on your original e<a href="mail.htm">mail</a>: I had already changed the colors of my <a href="web.htm">web</a>site from light-grey <small>(font)</small> on black <small>(<a href="back.htm">back</a>ground)</small> for exactly the kind of psychological reasons you mention, but I'm very dumb about this stuff - I mean about appearing "mainstream" and approachable.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing on it.<br/>

Well, if the tax were geometric, then it would be cheaper for 10 people to <a href="own.htm">own</a> 2 acres than it would for one person to <a href="own.htm">own</a> 20 acres.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, it would seem as though people would just form groups to buy it and then <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e their <a href="own.htm">own</a> deals between each other, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or they may come up with some other way I haven't thought of yet.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, we talked about this a bit the other day.&nbsp;&nbsp;In most cases I can think of, people can be self sufficient if taught - even if the hoarders remain unchanged.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen this happen in <a href="real.htm">real</a> life when a couple I <a href="know.htm">know</a> went to a poor area in a third world country and educated them about farming and raising rabbits, etc. and the whole village became self sufficient in less than two years.&nbsp;&nbsp;No hoarders needed to be dethroned either.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps this would be a first step to solving your main problems before attempting to dethrone all hoarders.<br/>
<br/>

<span class="h4">====From Patware:</span><br/>
<br/>
Though my metamessage may not correlate, I'm trying less to dethrone hoarders, and <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly just trying to debug <a href="real.htm">real</a>ity.<br/>
<br/>
I've concentrated too much on 'problems' and too little on 'solutions' over these last few years.<br/>
<br/>
I have finally <small>(daft)</small> <a href="real.htm">real</a>ized people don't want to hear about problems, and <small>(more importantly)</small> discussing them is actually not required <small>(just educational)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
I believe sustainability is a more common theme nowdays <small>(at least it seems to me)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, <a class="ext" href="http://downtownslc.org">downtownslc.org</a> is presenting a sustainability a Sustainable <a href="liv.htm">Liv</a>ing Festival:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="http://www.centralpt.com/pageview.aspx?id=6838">www.centralpt.com/pageview.aspx?id=6838</a><br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">"'The 2nd annual Sustainable <a href="liv.htm">Liv</a>ing Festival <span class="quot">"'<a href="liv.htm">LIV</a>E GREEN'"</span> on May 14th from 10am-6pm in downtown Salt Lake City's unique Pierpont Street on West Temple to 200 W.<br/>
<br/>
The festival will teach and promote basic principles of how to be more environmentally and <a href="ecol.htm">ecol</a>ogically conscientious while promoting downtown as a sustainable community.<br/>
<br/>
Companies involved in environmental preservation and conservation, renewable energy, health and wellness, sustainable agriculture, green design, and ecotourism will all be present.'"</span><br/>

<br/>
But be careful of wolves in sheep's clothing.<br/>
<br/>
The term "sustainable development" is also a UN push to privatize more finite re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es such as water and <a href="land.htm">land</a>, while 'allowing' the inhabitants to <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>e just one more step above the grave.<br/>

<br/>
While the big rollers may loosen the reigns to increase standard-of-<a href="liv.htm">liv</a>ing slightly, there is no reason for them to do so, and big reasons for them to not go too far.&nbsp;&nbsp;They would never want true sustainability because their <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts would no longer be needed, and the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers would no longer <a href="work.htm">work</a> for almost nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omic slavery requires <a href="work.htm">work</a>er dependence.<br/>

<br/>
oops, I'm talking about problems again...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="h4">====From a friend:</span><br/>
<br/>
Permit me to spew forth some thoughts that just <a href="cam.htm">cam</a>e to my mind regarding hoarding, etc.<br/>
<br/>
If we are to be true debuggers of the world, we must trace the bugs down to their <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e and fix them while at the same time resisting the temptation to throw band-aids on higher level symptoms.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do people hoard?&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where my opinion <a href="start.htm">start</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that people generally want to feel good, happy, important, and loved.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are just a few of the many emotional needs that we have.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have physical needs too, of course, and you have addressed those very well.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is much more to life than just physical needs though - physical needs do not drive a hoarder, for example.&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already met all of his physical needs - there must be something else underneath.&nbsp;&nbsp;We must dig deeper into code.<br/>
<br/>
I think that at the heart of hoarding <small>(and all "bad" behavior for that matter)</small> is rooted in not meeting these <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>amental emotional <small>(and physical)</small> needs <small>(you have already talked about the physical ones)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;When we fail to meet these needs, we are sad, miserable, feel worthless, and feel unimportant.&nbsp;&nbsp;We must end this miserable <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can hoard things to feel powerful, important, or sometimes just to feel good or distracted from our misery.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can take drugs that mimic the drugs that our body naturally <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es so that we can feel <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificially happy for a time -but it's always temporary and usually our bodies compensate, leaving us even more miserable than we <a href="start.htm">start</a>ed.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can try to get someone to like us through many manipulative methods to feel loved or important.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a whole world of emotional dysfunction lurking behind the physical dysfunction of which you speak.<br/>
<br/>
Our world is broken because we as people are broken.&nbsp;&nbsp;We as a world are generally failing to meet our <a href="own.htm">own</a> physical and emotional needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of this, we have also opted to <a href="use.htm">use</a> <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial means or temporary band-aids to "fix" our problems and those band-aids are not <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to call all of these band-aids "drugs" for simplicity's sake and for lack of a better term.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take away people's "drugs", they will look elsewhere for a <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> "drug".&nbsp;&nbsp;If we prohibit hoarding, for example, people will find some other way to subvert the laws created to prohibit it or will turn to some other form of <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificially satisfying their emotional needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless we can truly fulfill these basic needs in a natural way that lasts, I do not believe we will ever be able to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e enough laws and put on enough band-aids to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e things <a href="work.htm">work</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, we need some band-aids at times, but they are not the ultimate answer and they are only temporary <a href="work.htm">work</a>arounds, just like the ones we put in our code at times.&nbsp;&nbsp;They <a href="work.htm">work</a> for a time, but end up failing in the end.<br/>
<br/>
I have my <a href="own.htm">own</a> beliefs on how we can overcome the fears that prevent us from satisfying these emotional needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Satisfying these needs would then finally allow everyone to share what they have out of their <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="free.htm">free</a> will.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we will be able to satisfy our physical needs too, but I will not go into it here because it enters a <a href="real.htm">real</a>m that I do not think we want to go.&nbsp;&nbsp;:)</small><br/>

2005-05-12:<br/>
<span class="h4">====Answering a friend:</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp;I hesitate to discuss this yet again, as our philosophies are quite <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>.</span><br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that self-sufficiency and sustainable methodology is a good thing. I think it would be great if we, as a society, could share wealth and <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>as and all <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> therewith. But I'm pessimistic that such a thing will ever be. How long has society been around. Have we made any progress at all, in recorded hi<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>y? It's <a href="hard.htm">hard</a> to say, since I mostly <a href="know.htm">know</a> about my <a href="own.htm">own</a> time.</span><br/>
<br/>
Would you say world poverty is an unfortunate accident, or is there a chance it is purposefully enforced through <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty and tax law to concentrate the wealth of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers?&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> with Henry George's central claim about Poverty and Progress?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp;Your philosophy, as I understand it, is to fix the "system" through open <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e technology.</span><br/>
<br/>
No, my philosophy is to fix the "system" by enforcing Henry George's discoveries through Copy<a href="left.htm">left</a> licensing of _all_ finite and capital re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, not just technology.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp;My philosophy, is to learn to do things better on a more personal level, and share that <a href="know.htm">know</a>ledge I have with others around me who care to learn. Such the advantage to me and them.</span><br/>
<br/>
Sharing is important, but unless we lock <a href="know.htm">know</a>ledge open, the ones that benefit from our destitution will eventually <a href="use.htm">use</a> it against us.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't care so much about fixing the system, because I don't see how that is possible. To do so would require converting the masses, but from what I can see the masses are more interested in a <a href="free.htm">free</a> lunch than in fixing the system.</span><br/>
<br/>
I fully <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> that the 'masses' care only about themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;That's fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Communityism assumes all persons are greedy and lazy.<br/>
<br/>
I am unsure of is what you mean by "the system".&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are talking about the <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy, I could show <small>(my <a href="web.htm">web</a> page tries to explain)</small> how this can be approached from the bottom <small>(through finite re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership and licensing)</small> instead of the unacheivable goal of creating non-corporate-friendly legislation as Henry George attempted.<br/>
<br/>
As my original e<a href="mail.htm">mail</a> <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ed "This is not a plea for help".&nbsp;&nbsp;This has nothing to do with charity.&nbsp;&nbsp;This has only to do with capitalizing on the fact that <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity based organizations <small>(most all corporations, and obviously closed software shops such as our <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>er)</small> can be outdone by <a href="collab.htm">collab</a>orative efforts _only_ when the continuity of this <a href="collab.htm">collab</a>oration <small>(the ability to <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d on the <a href="work.htm">work</a> of others)</small> is <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ed.&nbsp;&nbsp;All we have ever needed to do is disallow hoarding.<br/>
<br/>
Henry George understood this and attempted to change the system from the top.&nbsp;&nbsp;But those already in power had too much to lose to allow this so he died a failure.<br/>
<br/>
But since we are _adding_ a law <small>(instead of subtracting)</small>, this requirement may also be enforced by simply retaining <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership and offering the <a href="use.htm">use</a> of the re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es in a restricted way.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the genius of the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why MicroSCOft hates the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> but loves BSD licenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;It gives communities the power of extended <a href="collab.htm">collab</a>oration which empowers people to finally dig their way out of the dependence and destitution that is an intentional <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the world <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="rms.htm">RMS</a>'s <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> wasn't much of any threat to such business when he wrote it <small>(around 1985)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first few years must have been terribly un<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive and messy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people hearing of his scheme must have scoffed and <a href="imag.htm">imag</a>ined "This will never <a href="work.htm">work</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;People only care about a <a href="free.htm">free</a> lunch".&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently true of my <small>(unfinished)</small> Sovereign Re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e License.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a pitifully untested and mostly un<a href="start.htm">start</a>ed situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;But that doesn't prove the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>as are wrong.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp;Which isn't to say that I don't think society could benefit, if I improve my <a href="own.htm">own</a> position through learning sustainable farming or any other such technique. I think that it would be great if I could discover a way to generate clean renewable energy, and then I would give it away to the masses. It would solve many problems. But I don't think it would fix the system.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot2">>>&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you allow me to purchase plants for you, entering into an <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment to <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ogate those plants within a specified period to another person under the same conditions?</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp;You've mentioned this before, but I don't <a href="know.htm">know</a> what you hope to accomplish by it. There are several groups out that give away <a href="free.htm">free</a> trees, or encourage tree planting. How does your <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>er any from them?</span><br/>
<br/>
These trees you speak of are _never_ gifting.&nbsp;&nbsp;My offer applies _ONLY_ to gifting plants.&nbsp;&nbsp;All non-gifting plants are weeds.&nbsp;&nbsp;Offers to plant these valuless plants misdirect us into spending time, <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y, water, etc. on yet more trash agriculture so our dependence on murderous corporations continues.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> Also, I already get plants for an inexpensive <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e, and I have given plants away. So how is your method any <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>?</span><br/>
<br/>
Your charity is <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> from my business plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;Giving away plants with no obligation from the receiver is akin to releasing <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code to the Public Domain or under a BSD-like license.&nbsp;&nbsp;For one thing you are not <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ing the future of those organism genetics <small>(see <a class="ext" href="http://www.iraqcoalition.org/regulations/20040426_CPAORD_81_Patents_Law.pdf">www.iraqcoalition.org/regulations/20040426_CPAORD_81_Patents_Law.pdf</a> for another example of corporate greed feeding on the brave people of the once sovereign nation of Iraq)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;But more importantly, the <a href="permaculture propagation project.htm">Permaculture Propagation Project</a> also _requires_ the plants be <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ogated under these same conditions within a limited timeframe.&nbsp;&nbsp;This causes a viral situation similar to the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot2">>> How will we guarantee <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of <a href="land.htm">land</a> in the future when <a href="job.htm">job</a>s are not guaranteed, and almost none of us actually <a href="own.htm">own</a> our homes?&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you help invest in <a href="land.htm">land</a>?</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp;What is <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership anyways? Is it not an <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial whim of the goverment? If the government decides, they can take your <a href="land.htm">land</a> from you, for little or no compensation. It happened recently in Provo, when the government wanted to <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d a road through some orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a>s. The <a href="own.htm">own</a>er said no, so the city just took the <a href="land.htm">land</a>.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp;More often, it happens through the courts. For whatever reason you can be sued. If the court rules against you, you can easily lose your <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty for an unjust cause. Even if you win, you still lose <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty through court fees.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sorry to say that your goal is worthy, but I don't believe that guaranteeing <a href="land.htm">land</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is something that can be done. If it could be done with our <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent government, there is no guarantee that a <a href="new.htm">new</a> government wouldn't revoke our rights to the <a href="land.htm">land</a>.</span><br/>
<br/>
Maybe guarantee was the wrong word.&nbsp;&nbsp;I <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> the whole thing could come down, but even you don't think the chance is so high that you were unwilling to begin purchasing a house.&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously we must <a href="work.htm">work</a> within whatever system we find ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am more interested in, is learning these techniques myself. I <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently am experimenting with growing a garden, which last year yielded sub-par results. What I would like to do is to <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d a greenhouse which would supply an able gardening environment year-round. But to do so I would need to keep it heated. So would the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of heating the greenhouse, be more than the benefit of growing the plants? Also there are other such considerations. I suspect that I will never <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d the greenhouse anyways, since I'm not much at doing things that I don't understand.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd also like to create my <a href="own.htm">own</a> compost, but even after reading lots of <a href="art.htm">art</a>icles on the subject, I'm not sure that I <a href="know.htm">know</a> how to do it.</span><br/>
<br/>
Yes, we need locked open design for such things, and we need access to tools and materials _at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>_ so that when we <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> a <a href="work.htm">work</a>er to <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d a greenhouse we are <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing for materials and labor; _never_ to pad the pockets of some external <a href="own.htm">own</a>er opening checks as he lounges in the sun.<br/>
<br/>
It is also worth noting that sustainable technologies in general are a threat to most <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent business <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>els which helps explain our excruciatingly slow progress in that direction.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp;When I asked how your plot of <a href="land.htm">land</a> was developing, it was not to mock that you've not done anything <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive. Rather I am somewhat interested in any results that you have made.</span><br/>
<br/>
Sorry I misread that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp;The open farm does sound like an interesting <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a. Were you asking if you and I could do that, or if generally somebody could do it? I think that such a project would require a good leader. But if there were such a leader, then it could be made to <a href="work.htm">work</a>.</span><br/>
<br/>
Because people tend to have a psychological need for leaders, I think your claim&nbsp;&nbsp;is probably true but don't understand what such a leader would need to do.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">>&nbsp;&nbsp;So I don't <a href="know.htm">know</a> if I've made sense or just rambled. I'm interested more in the technologies than in the politics of your <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>as.</span><br/>
<br/>
You may not have noticed <small>(probably because of my continuous concern and references to corporatism)</small>, but my <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>osal requires no 'political' action.&nbsp;&nbsp;It can all be done through normal <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership and careful licensing.<br/>

While the concepts I've gathered are provably correct, they are <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult to communicate without offense because in order to understand them, we must admit that poverty was purposefully created by those who understand the leverage of dependence.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is _by design_.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not an accident.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an ancient business plan enforced through finite re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e hoarding and improvement taxation.<br/>
<br/>
The book "The End of Poverty" appears to be yet another move by world-government re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e hoarding <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers to allow the people held under their thumbs a few gasps of breath.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
While the big rollers may loosen the reigns to increase standard-of-<a href="liv.htm">liv</a>ing slightly, there is no reason for them to do so, and big reasons for them to not go too far.&nbsp;&nbsp;They would never want true sustainability because their <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts would no longer be needed, and the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers would no longer <a href="work.htm">work</a> for almost nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omic slavery requires <a href="work.htm">work</a>er dependence.<br/>

This "Order" was penned for pigs such as Monsanto who want to create dependence by disallowing Iraqi farmers from <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ogating wheat varieties.&nbsp;&nbsp;This can happen because Monsanto will be shipping in their dangerous GMO shit wheat.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wheat pollen may travel miles.&nbsp;&nbsp;The law is written such that: any wheat 'infected' with this "locked closed" DNA is designated Monsanto <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty - and as such, cannot be <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ogated <small>(the farmers can't <a href="use.htm">use</a> the offspring seeds for next year's planting)</small> unless Monsanto is paid a licensing fee.<br/>

I understand the problem and solution are immense, and seem too large to even talk about, but why <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e fun of the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a of growing plants that are beneficial to those in need?&nbsp;&nbsp;While corn may not please your eye, you <small>(probably didn't)</small> notice I never mentioned corn.<br/>
<br/>
How about some of the herbs I mentioned, or maybe just some flax?&nbsp;&nbsp;You will be growing a variety of <a href="use.htm">use</a>less little plants.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why must we continue to enforce our <a href="own.htm">own</a> dependence on these corporate criminals?<br/>

<br/>
Poverty and the threat of poverty are tools which allow corporations to finally drive government policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is corporatism.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Benito Mussolini said: "Fascism should more ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riately be called corporatism, since it is the merger of <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e and corporate power."<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent fascists occupying the White House, and all those to come will continue to be supported by imperialistic corporations who have only to gain by enforcing poverty, dependence and unsustainable practices throughout the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pharmaceutical, automotive, energy, entertainment, agriculture, etc. lobbyists are sometimes so influential they actually _write_ portions of the <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>osed legislation.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an extension of the Military Industrial Complex.<br/>

&nbsp; How <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity is a powerful way to concentrate wealth, and how the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> addresses that issue.<br/>

I'm closer to understanding how to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e this all happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm trying to complete the licenses and contracts and become incorporated <small>(non-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> to allow normal 'venture capital' <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic investment strategies.&nbsp;&nbsp;This should aleviate much of the psychological blocks by <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a seem like just other business.<br/>
<br/>
I believe the revenue potential is high, but ramping up will be slow.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would love to find a way to present the notion of growing the organisms and "locking open" the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hinery to supply us with our needs.<br/>
<br/>
I am prepared to invest $10,000 in that direction - especially to have those plants growing on another's soil.&nbsp;&nbsp;I <a href="own.htm">own</a> a very large shop, and could house the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hinery there.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a never seems anything but insane and misguided.<br/>
<br/>

Aside from organized religions or doctrines <small>(that you obviously reject and that you for the most <a href="part.htm">part</a> have a good point when you talk about abuse in the name of various forms of god)</small>, your response doesn't address Kreeft's arguments - for example the first and the most simple argument "where is a creation there must be a creator" when it comes to most <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>amental basics of existence.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, in most cases things can be explained by "natural laws" but when you proceed to the very origin of everything or infinitely complex matters, "chance based or nature" based explanations don't <a href="real.htm">real</a>ly stand - explaining things by the same thing that you are trying to explain is a false and weak argument. It is like saying, "things appear because they appear".<br/>
<br/>
Other <a href="thread.htm">thread</a>s in your site on that matter basically revolve around religions and how humans <a href="use.htm">use</a> or manipulate religions to their advantages.

<br/>
While I usually call myself an antitheist <small>(I am against the act of believing in monotheistic gods - as the division, oppression and deceit is not worth the supposed gains)</small>, it's probably more accurate to describe me as a pantheist:<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">"'Pantheists do not <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ose belief in a deity; rather, they hold nature itself as a creative presence.

<br/>
This gives me more hope that <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>rietary NT drivers may one day be hosted on <a href="free.htm">Free</a> platforms - which will end the ability of M$ to enforce <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity through <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ware manufacturer <a href="part.htm">part</a>nering.&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, ATI drivers - especially for the TV features of <a href="new.htm">new</a>er AllInWonder - are only available to M$ <a href="user.htm">user</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers beg for specifications <small>[ <a class="ext" href="http://gatos.sourceforge.net">gatos.sourceforge.net</a> ]</small> so they can solve the problem, but ATI's actions are slow and elusive.&nbsp;&nbsp;This gives <a href="user.htm">user</a>s <small>(like me for instance)</small> no choice if they wish to fully utilize that <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ware.)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Do you see the ability to interoperate as "good for the <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy", or "bad for the <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy"?<br/>
<br/>
I am not advocating laws to 'force' cooperation, but am wondering how cooperation effects those on the is<a href="land.htm">land</a> - especially when <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity is enforced through <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty law.<br/>

So your point is that you can't get drivers for your ATI card <small>(etc.)</small> for Linux but you might be able to get one for windows and wrap it and <a href="use.htm">use</a> it on Linux, right?&nbsp;&nbsp;I <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>e in that world in <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing in DOS where the NIC drivers are not as up-to-date as the windows ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't see a problem with that since the drivers are usually <a href="free.htm">free</a> to customers anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="hard.htm">Hard</a>ware manufacturers get most of their <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y by selling <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ware and they give away their drivers for <a href="free.htm">free</a> to the customers so they can <a href="use.htm">use</a> the <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ware.&nbsp;&nbsp;It <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s them <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y to develop those drivers and so they look at their customers and see what percentage of them are on windows, Linux, dos, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's say that 90% are on windows 5% are on Linux and 5% are on "other" OS's.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's say that each driver <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s $100,000 to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think this <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ware manufacturer is trying to pull a fast one; they're just trying to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e a buck and stay in business.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have specific information saying that they are trying to pull a fast one or perhaps they are just trying to stay in business and <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e a buck?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
----patware<br/>
By "<a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing a buck" are you saying "It is simply not <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> effective for ATI to write Linux drivers."?&nbsp;&nbsp;With this I <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What I don't understand is why ATI won't release documentation which would allow Linux/BSD hackers to write the driver _for <a href="free.htm">free</a>_!&nbsp;&nbsp;That could save ATI $100,000 right?<br/>
<br/>
I think your response will be "because they don't want to release <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>rietary information that could help their competition".<br/>
<br/>
If that is what you would say, I then ask "would such documentation necessarily expose such <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e secrets?"&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it impossible to write drivers without <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing the <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ware design open as well?&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe the answer is yes, and maybe that is why there are no <small>(complete)</small> <a href="free.htm">free</a> ATI drivers.<br/>
<br/>
In that case I wonder if it would be better for the is<a href="land.htm">land</a>ers if such <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ware designs were also locked open <small>(as decided by the '<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers', not mandated by law)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a project for a <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>ed video card: <a class="ext" href="http://icculus.org/manticore">icculus.org/manticore</a><br/>
<br/>
Though it is mostly just for fun right now, I wonder if the benefits of locked open design could ever be managed in such a way as to become as much of an <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic threat to locked closed <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ware as locked open software is becoming to <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>rietary software shops <small>(if you believe there is such a <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent threat)</small>.<br/>

----NB<br/>
ATI wouldn't need to expose their <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ware design for the open <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e<br/>
community to write drivers for ATI cards.&nbsp;&nbsp;ATI would simply need to provide<br/>
the necessary interfacing information for writing such drivers.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think<br/>
it's very likely that there are some techniques/<a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e-secrets that would be<br/>
revealed if the interface itself was published.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the only reason I<br/>
can think of that would cause ATI to not publish their interfaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;If<br/>
publishing the interface wouldn't give their competition any advantage, then<br/>
ATI would have a good incentive to do so because it would increase their<br/>
sales to the linux community.&nbsp;&nbsp;It certainly would be better for the<br/>
is<a href="land.htm">land</a>ers=consumers if <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ware designs were open.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I'd be<br/>
surprised to see open <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ware grow as quickly as the open software<br/>
movement.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is that any joe-with-a-box out there can augment an<br/>
open <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e project.&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of people who could take advantage of open<br/>
<a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ware is much smaller - they need'd often need manufacturing equipment in<br/>
order to implement the designs and relatively few people <small>(compared to the<br/>
software community)</small> have access to fabs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, that's a generalization, not<br/>
everyone would need a fab <small>(they could <a href="use.htm">use</a> PROMs, EPROMs, PGAs, etc)</small> but then<br/>
again, how many <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter-savy guys do you <a href="know.htm">know</a> who even have an EPROM<br/>

I am happy you are only pretending to be asleep.<br/>
<br/>
I've been studying this problem and possible solutions for about 5 years now.<br/>
<br/>
To even explain the problem is exhausting.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will try to summarize:<br/>
First we must understand we are being divided.&nbsp;&nbsp;Terms such as Democrat, Republican, <a href="lib.htm">Lib</a>eral, Right-wing, etc. only serve to keep us fighting amongst ourselves.<br/>

<br/>
The first problem is that corporations - and in fact any concentration of wealth - has undue influence on political systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;An especially incestuous form of this is the "Military Industrial Complex" that President Eisenhower warned of.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very obvious if you look at past and present holdings of the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent villains.&nbsp;&nbsp;Researching "Carlyle Group" is a good <a href="start.htm">start</a>ing point.<br/>

<span class="quot">"'Letter to Congress on Increasing U.S. Ground Forces<br/>
January 28, 2005<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dear Senator Frist, Senator Reid, Speaker Hastert, and Representative Pelosi:<br/>
<br/>
The United <a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>es military is too small for the responsibilities we are asking it to assume. Those responsibilities are <a href="real.htm">real</a> and important. They are not going away. The United <a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>es will not and should not become less engaged in the world in the years to come. But our national security, global peace and stability, and the defense and promotion of <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom in the post-9/11 world require a larger military force than we have today. The <a href="admin.htm">admin</a>istration has unfortunately resisted increasing our ground forces to the size needed to meet today's <small>(and tomorrow's)</small> missions and challenges.<br/>
<br/>
So we write to ask you and your colleagues in the legislative branch to take the steps necessary to increase substantially the size of the active duty Army and Marine Corps. While estimates vary about just how large an increase is required, and Congress will <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e its <a href="own.htm">own</a> determination as to size and structure, it is our judgment that we should aim for an increase in the active duty Army and Marine Corps, together, of at least 25,000 troops each year over the next several years.<br/>
<br/>
There is abundant evidence that the demands of the ongoing missions in the greater Middle East, along with our continuing defense and alliance commitments elsewhere in the world, are close to exhausting <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent U.S. ground forces. For example, just late last month, Lieutenant General James Helmly, chief of the Army Reserve, reported that "overuse" in Iraq and Afghanistan could be leading to a "broken force." Yet after almost two years in Iraq and almost three years in Afghanistan, it should be evident that our engagement in the greater Middle East is truly, in Condoleezza Rice's term, a "generational commitment." The only way to fulfill the military aspect of this commitment is by increasing the size of the force available to our civilian leadership.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="admin.htm">admin</a>istration has been reluctant to adapt to this <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="real.htm">real</a>ity. We understand the dangers of continued federal deficits, and the fiscal <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>iculty of increasing the number of troops. But the defense of the United <a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>es is the first priority of the government. This nation can afford a robust defense posture along with a strong fiscal posture. And we can afford both the necessary number of ground troops and what is needed for transformation of the military.<br/>
<br/>
In sum: We can afford the military we need. As a nation, we are spending a smaller percentage of our GDP on the military than at any time during the Cold War. We do not <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ose returning to a Cold War-size or shape force structure. We do insist that we act responsibly to create the military we need to fight the war on terror and fulfill our other responsibilities around the world.<br/>
<br/>
The men and women of our military have performed magnificently over the last few years. We are more proud of them than we can say. But many of them would be the first to say that the armed forces are too small. And we would say that surely we should be doing more to honor the contract between America and those who serve her in war. Reserves were meant to be reserves, not regulars. Our regulars and reserves are not only proving themselves as warriors, but as humanitarians and <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>ders of emerging democracies. Our armed forces, active and reserve, are once again proving their value to the nation. We can honor their sacrifices by giving them the manpower and the materiel they need.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="art.htm">Art</a>icle 1, <a href="sect.htm">Sect</a>ion 8 of the Constitution places the power and the duty to raise and support the military forces of the United <a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>es in the hands of the Congress. That is why we, the undersigned, a bi<a href="part.htm">part</a>isan group with diverse policy views, have come together to call upon you to act. You will be serving your country well if you insist on providing the military manpower we need to meet America's obligations, and to help ensure success in carrying out our foreign policy <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ectives in a dangerous, but also hopeful, world.<br/>

Discussing the problem of hoarding today.<br/>
A co<a href="work.htm">work</a>er told me it must be this way.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic divide is required for success.<br/>
If we don't step on others, how will we get up?<br/>
<br/>
This is troubling and strange, though I see he's unsure.<br/>
The <a href="real.htm">real</a> trouble <a href="cam.htm">cam</a>e when I taught him the conclusion is murder.<br/>
<br/>
To recognize Fascism is a road that we unwittingly <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d.<br/>
Is a terrifying concept, and under cover should be held.<br/>
<br/>
The co<a href="work.htm">work</a>er, as most, thinks our leaders mean best<br/>
So the conversation was pointless, humorous at best.<br/>
<br/>
It took a long time, and when we were through,<br/>
Another co<a href="work.htm">work</a>er decided this just wouldn't do.<br/>
<br/>
So he raised up his voice to announce his displeasure.<br/>
By bleating a phrase so pure it's a treasure.<br/>
<br/>
As one of the masses so dutifully led down the road.<br/>
Giving the cry of the master "Can we get to <a href="work.htm">work</a> now?"<br/>
<br/>
For this <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hina of death that rolls over the <a href="land.htm">land</a>.<br/>
In the name of peace it destroys home<a href="land.htm">land</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
We plunder, we kill, we rape and we maim.<br/>
Through the military industrial complex we call democracy.<br/>
<br/>

The ward mission leader with the Mormon missionaries appeared on my doorstep at 7:45 pm last night.<br/>
<br/>
Our unwitting sopport of terror.<br/>

Mercedes-Benz made a few hybrids in 1982.<br/>
