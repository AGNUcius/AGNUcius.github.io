<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> = <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e - <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a><br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> means "to progress" in Latin, but that would require it be treated as an investment from the <a href="user.htm">user</a> that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s it.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> measures the <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er's lack of <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
Treating <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as that <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er's investment is a negative feed<a href="back.htm">back</a> loop that allows sufficient growth <small>(as much as the <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er is willing to <a href="work.htm">Work</a>)</small> while inhibiting the overaccumulation caused by the rich getting richer.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is "<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>".&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the pressure that causes consumers to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> more for berries than it <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e them.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> requires <a href="real.htm">real</a> or <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial rivalry/scarcity.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the portion of <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e, <a href="rent.htm">Rent</a>, Tax or Interest that goes beyond <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;That <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> becomes usury unless it is treated as an investment from the consumer who paid it.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is an inverse measure of competition and a direct measure of monopoly.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> should be interpreted as a plea for development because it measures consumer dependence.&nbsp;&nbsp;Usury gained against consumers disrespects their natural desire to grow, so hampers true progress.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>er wages are a valid <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, but <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers are consumers too, and taking advantage of consumer vulnerability steps on the undeveloped.<br/>
<br/>
Capitalist <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers compete against other <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers to keep consumer <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s, but non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ing <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers cannot compete directly because they do not have access to the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
While <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers might "unite" as Marx suggested to buy some <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es <small>(say a plant)</small>, they would also soon be usurists if they did not treat <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as consumer investment.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect consumers who <a href="own.htm">own</a> the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of those <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects may hire <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers, but <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is undefined since <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers also <a href="own.htm">own</a> the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion even before they are created.<br/>
<br/>
Why do we <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> Exxon so much <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>?&nbsp;&nbsp;Why don't we, the Consumers, just <a href="own.htm">OWN</a> the oil rigs ourselves and <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers the same as they <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently receive? It would save us *so much* <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y.<br/>
<br/>
Physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es such as <a href="land.htm">land</a>, plants, tools, <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>dings, etc. are held <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificially scarce by <small>(often ignorant, so somewhat blameless)</small> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>eers.<br/>
<br/>
If the qualified <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers could access these <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>", we could <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d any car we <small>(the consumers)</small> could dream up.&nbsp;&nbsp;If consumers <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, they would be in control, and could finally truely demand the most advanced of designs for <a href="game.htm">game</a> consoles, media players, video cards, clothing, food, etc. even when those solutions "ruin the market" for usurists.&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the usual <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity and externalization required to hold usury in place, the consuming <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers would allow every <a href="art.htm">art</a>isan to compete directly against every other <a href="art.htm">art</a>isan to quickly outperform the dinosaurs of <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>rietary Capitalism - where only <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers compete with other <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers while consumers and <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers have little say.<br/>

An unfortunate misunderstanding by a prominent <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omist:<br/>
<span class="quot">"'<br/>
When I hear businessmen speak eloquently about the "social responsibilities of business in a <a href="free.htm">free</a>-enterprise system", I am reminded of the wonderful line about the Frenchman who discovered at the age of 70 that he had been speaking prose all his life. The businessmen believe that they are defending <a href="free.htm">free</a> enterprise when they declaim that business is not concerned "merely" with <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> but also with promoting desirable "social" ends; that business has a "social conscience" and takes seriously its responsibilities for providing <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ment, eliminating discrimination, avoiding pollution and whatever else may be the catchwords of the contemporary crop of reformers. In fact they are --- or would be if they or anyone else took them seriously -preaching pure and unadulterated socialism. Businessmen who talk this way are unwitting puppets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a <a href="free.htm">free</a> society these past decades.'"</span> -- Milton Friedman in "Corporate Ethics and Corporate Governance" Chapter en<a href="title.htm">title</a>d "The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>s" <a class="ext" href="http://SpringerLink.com/content/m2141pp14981487h">SpringerLink.com/content/m2141pp14981487h</a><br/>

Yes, 'utilization' is a massive problem for us now.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sharing the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion<br/>
<br/>
Utilize <a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e and tools by scheduling access<br/>
<br/>
<a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s<br/>
&nbsp;and cover the <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of initial<br/>
purchase and upkeep for the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion that<br/>
a group of people need, then we can escape the usual<br/>
problem of absentee-<a href="land.htm">land</a>lords controlling our decisions,<br/>
and also avoid <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership&nbsp;&nbsp; is based on <br/>
&nbsp;who need the outputs are the<br/>
&nbsp;people that need the results of those<br/>
tools <small>(the consumers)</small> are the very same people that<br/>
<span class="bullet">*</span><a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>* the tools, then they must still <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s<br/>
of that <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership as usual, but they would not <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> more<br/>
than <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s <small>(they do not <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small>, for who would they<br/>
<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> that extra value to?<br/>
<br/>
This maximizes competition between <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers, allowing<br/>
the consumer-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers to choose any qualified <a href="art.htm">art</a>isan to<br/>
operate or maintain that <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine.<br/>
<br/>
But, if the people those tools are the people that happen<br/>
to <a href="know.htm">know</a> how to operate and maintain those tools, <small>(the<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>ers)</small> then those <a href="work.htm">work</a>er-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers will not allow outside<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>ers to compete against them <small>(they would not <a href="rent.htm">rent</a><br/>
the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hines to those outsiders for the <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of<br/>
operation)</small>, and yet they would only <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s<br/>
of operation when using the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hines themselves - and<br/>
so they would <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificially <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>-up wages, becoming small-<br/>
time capitalists and collecting <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as inflated wages.<br/>
<br/>
And so it seems to me the most efficient form for co-<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is one where the end-<a href="user.htm">user</a>s of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t<br/>
<small>(the consumers)</small> are the <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers of the Means of<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion even when they have no <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a how to operate<br/>
or maintain those tools.<br/>
<br/>
For example, <a href="imag.htm">imag</a>ine a neighborhood of people that<br/>
occasionally need holes drilled with a power-drill, but<br/>
none of them <a href="know.htm">know</a>s how to operate such a <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine.<br/>
<br/>
If they do not <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> a power drill, then there are two<br/>
typical scenarios that will occur when any one of them<br/>
needs to have a hole drilled:<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> They will contact an independent <a href="work.htm">work</a>er-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er to<br/>
bring his <a href="own.htm">own</a> power-drill to do the <a href="work.htm">work</a> for some a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a><br/>
of compensation <small>(let's say $10 for 10 minutes of <a href="work.htm">work</a>)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
This <a href="work.htm">work</a>er-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er must cover all of his <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s, and he<br/>
must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> himself a wage.<br/>
<br/>
It is <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult to <a href="know.htm">know</a> if he is also collecting <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> unless<br/>
we bring a competitor on the scene as described next.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> The will contact a business which is <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by a<br/>
typical capitalist who hires all the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers to do the<br/>
same <a href="job.htm">job</a> as described in #1.<br/>
<br/>
This capitalist will probably charge approximately the<br/>
same a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> per hole, and must cover all the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s<br/>
of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <small>(initial purchase of the drill, wear and<br/>
tear on the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine, etc.)</small> and wages, just the same<br/>
as in #1.<br/>
<br/>
But if doesn't have any <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y <a href="left.htm">left</a>-over after <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing all<br/>
of those <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s, then, by definition, he does not have<br/>
any <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
And so, he will probably <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er less that what<br/>
the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er in #1 received.<br/>
<br/>
If so, then we have proved the #1 paid himself the wage<br/>
that <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers will accept for that <a href="job.htm">job</a> and *also* paid<br/>
himself some <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
This means <a href="work.htm">work</a>er #2 <a href="work.htm">work</a>s for less compensation than<br/>
#1 does, and yet, #1 does not have access to a drill that<br/>
is needed for that <a href="work.htm">work</a>...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And so we see, if the drill <small>(the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion)</small> is/are<br/>
<a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ed by those that need the goods of services that<br/>
are achieved by those tools, then competition between<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>ers is maximized <small>(the consumers can hire whoever<br/>
has those <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s)</small>, and so <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is eliminated.<br/>
