Many will say "without <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>, who will invest?".<br/>
<br/>
My answer is: Some consumers already want to invest, but are unsure where to "put their <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y".<br/>

<br/>
crisis of accumulation of capital<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, we lack a mechanism for the existing institutional world to re-<a href="fund.htm">fund</a> what it receives from the social world. So on top of all of that, we have a crisis of social re<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion: peer <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is collectively sustainable, but not individually.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thus, there are two simultaneous crises: first, the failure of <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial abundance through subsidized inputs and externalization of <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>, endless supplies of natural re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es for ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riation <small>(aided by <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e favortism)</small>, and the availability of <a href="new.htm">new</a> markets as outlets for surplus capital and output;<br/>
<br/>
and s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>d, the failure of <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity in the cognitive <a href="real.htm">real</a>m. Taken together, this means that while markets and private <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of physical capital will persist, “the core logic of the emerging experience <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy, operating as it does in the world of non-rival exchange, is unlikely to have capitalism as its core logic.”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Johan Soderberg relates this crisis of <a href="real.htm">real</a>ization under <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e capitalism to capital’s growing dependence on the <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e to capture value from social <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and redistribute it to private corporate <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers. This takes the form both of “intellectual <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty” law, as well as direct subsidies from the taxpayer to the corporate <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy. He compares, specifically, the way photocopiers were <a href="moni.htm">moni</a>tored in the old USSR to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> the power of elites in that country, to the way the means of digital re<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion are <a href="moni.htm">moni</a>tored in this country to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> corporate power. <small>[Hacking Capitalism, pp. 144-145.]</small> James O’Connor’s theme, of the ever-expanding portion of the operating expenses of capital which come from the <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e, is also relevant here. <small>[The Fiscal Crisis of the <a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>e]</small> The important point is that this strategy of shifting the burden of <a href="real.htm">real</a>ization onto the <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e is untenable. The proliferation of bittor<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> and episodes like the DeCSS uprising have shown that “intellectual <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty” is ultimately unenforceable. The RIAA’s shakedown operation can be circumvented by the simple expedients of encryption and proxy servers. And as we have already seen, in an <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy of subsidized inputs, the demand for such inputs grows exponentially, faster than the <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e can meet them. The <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e capitalist system will reach a point at which, thanks to the collapse of the portion of value comprised of <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>s on <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, the base of taxable value is imploding at the very time big business most needs subsidies to stay afloat.<br/>
<br/>
In another <a href="art.htm">art</a>icle, in which he develops these themes at greater length, Bauwens writes that capitalism’s successor system is likely to have a significant role for markets, but that the two structural presuppositions of existing capitalism–<a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial abundance of re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es and <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity of information–will be replaced by the reverse.<br/>
<br/>
We <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>e in a political <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy that has it exactly <a href="back.htm">back</a>wards. We believe that our natural world is infinite, and therefore that we can have an <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic system based on infinite growth. But since the material world is finite, it is based on pseudo-abundance.<br/>
<br/>
And then we believe that we should introduce <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcities in the world of immaterial <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, impeding the <a href="free.htm">free</a> flow of culture and social innovation, which is based on <a href="free.htm">free</a> cooperation, by creating the obstacle of permissions and intellectual <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>s <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ed by the <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
What we need instead is a political <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy based on a true notion of scarcity in the material <a href="real.htm">real</a>m, and a <a href="real.htm">real</a>ization of abundance in the immaterial <a href="real.htm">real</a>m.<br/>
<br/>
In the purely immaterial <a href="real.htm">real</a>m, the services of capital are becoming increasingly superfluous, as described by Michael <a href="hard.htm">Hard</a>t and Antonio Negri:<br/>
<br/>
…the cooperative aspect of immaterial labor is not imposed or organized from the outside, as it was in previous forms of labor, but rather, cooperation is completely immanent to the laboring activity itself. This fact calls into question the old notion <small>(common to classical and Marxian political <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omics)</small> by which labor power is conceived as “variable capital,” that is, a force that is activated and made cohe<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> only by capital…. Brains and bodies still need others to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e value, but the others they need are not necessarily provided by capital and its capacities to organize <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion. Today <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tivity, wealth, and the creation of social surpluses take the form of cooperative interactivity through linguistic, communicational, and affective <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>s. <small>[Michael <a href="hard.htm">Hard</a>t and Antonio Negri, Empire <small>(<a href="cam.htm">Cam</a>bridge and London: Harvard University Press, 2000)</small>, p. 294.]</small><br/>
<br/>
In addition, capitalism faces a crisis of <a href="real.htm">real</a>ization in another regard that Bauwens does not directly address. For over two centuries, as Immanuel Wallerstein observed, the system of capitalist <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion based on wage labor has depended on the ability to externalize many of its re<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion functions on the non-<a href="mone.htm">mone</a>tized informal and household <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omies, and on organic social institutions like the family which were outside the cash nexus.<br/>
<br/>
Hi<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>ically, capital has relied upon its superior bargaining power to set the boundary between the <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y and social <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omies to its <a href="own.htm">own</a> advantage. The household and informal <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omies have been allowed to function to the extent that they bear re<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s that would otherwise have to be internalized in wages; but they have been suppressed <small>(as in the Enclosures)</small> when they threaten to increase in size and importance to the point of offering a basis for independence from wage labor. “<br/>

<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a link: for the last 30 years, the bulk of the value is immaterial, and it cannot be measured in any good way by the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>tary system, hence the wild gyrations as the market forces vainly try to estimate the ‘value’. The enormous suplus in <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y floating around, is constantly searching to create speculative bubbles, mostly based on inflated estimatios of such immaterial value.<br/>
