Is he saying we *must* lose <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom when sharing <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ware?&nbsp;&nbsp;I think he means "under the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent conditions".&nbsp;&nbsp;These problems will increase pressure to finish writing a <a href="general public law.htm">General Public Law</a> for sharing <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty<a href="left.htm">Left</a> <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ware.<br/>

Instead of allowing people to do the things they wish to do, they setup, uh, a system of power which resembles .... any sort of .. tyranny, or perhaps, in fact, most resembles a feudal system because each program has it's lord, and when you're using that program it's like being in the territory of a lord.&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lord simply has power over whatever happens there.&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of a <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>rietary program is a command based system like the one in the soviet union.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, uh, it's complete superstition to think that <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>rietary software fits better with a <a href="free.htm">free</a> market, <a href="free.htm">free</a> enterprise system than <a href="free.htm">free</a> software does.'"</span> -- <a class="ext" href="http://NearthWort.com/2007/02/04/nearthwort-podcast-11-richard-stallman-founder-of-the-free-software-movement">NearthWort.com/2007/02/04/nearthwort-podcast-11-richard-stallman-founder-of-the-free-software-movement</a><br/>
