The concept of "<a href="source freedom.htm">Source Freedom</a>" is one in which the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s of an <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect gain "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" access to the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of those <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Pure information such as <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>as, plans, intellect, software, video, audio, genetics, or any design of any kind is not rivalrous, so does not need <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.&nbsp;&nbsp;But each copy must be "hosted" by the rivalrous <a href="land.htm">land</a> and capital needed to <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>e, copy and express it.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this inescapable connection to the physical world that <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es bread and software both infinite in potential, but always limited immediately by the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent number of copies in existence, and into the future by the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es and labor needed to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e more copies.<br/>
<br/>
We can think of information as the '<a href="virt.htm">Virt</a>ual' <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, while 'Physical' <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es are the material aspects of <a href="real.htm">real</a>ity such as <a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e, mass and energy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples of physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es include <a href="land.htm">land</a>, water, sunlight, seeds/eggs/spores, <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>dings, tools, <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ters, electricity, gas, food, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Information is non-rivalrous in and of itself, but it cannot be utilized, and will often even cease to exist without Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es for <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age and expression.<br/>
<br/>
The design of a car, the data and code composing a software program, the genetics of a <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>ing organism, a <a href="pic.htm">pic</a>ture, an e<a href="mail.htm">mail</a>, a video or song, etc. always requires physical <a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e, mass and energy to <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>e and express it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Information is not infinite ONLY because it is permanently anchored to the physical world through this requirement of hosting.&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, when you copy a program, the <a href="new.htm">new</a> copy must be <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>ed on optical, magnetic or 'flash' media which itself requires <a href="spac.htm">spac</a>e; and the entire operation requires electricity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the program is so small that you can just memorize it, and type it in at another terminal, it still must reside in your grey matter until transfer it through the <a href="key.htm">key</a>board to the RAM and then <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>-drive of the <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter you <a href="work.htm">work</a> at.<br/>
<br/>
So, while the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a> can be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to <a href="free.htm">free</a> any information, we are still at the mercy of those that <a href="own.htm">own</a> the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es required for hosting and manufacturing.<br/>
<br/>
Small-time hosting is fairly cheap and easy for an individual, but some things are too expensive to be held by a single person, or are only meaningful in a group setting.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hinery and <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>dings needed to manufacture cars and <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ters are terribly expensive and out of reach for a single individual.&nbsp;&nbsp;Settings such as a "community center" and the physical infrastructure of a <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> are usually only meaningful if more than one person is <a href="part.htm">part</a>icipating.<br/>
<br/>
So it is <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful to be able to "share" or "<a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>" re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, but this organization is typically <a href="left.htm">left</a> to those that intend to extract <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> from the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s that need the outputs of those facilities.<br/>
<br/>
As a community of <a href="user.htm">user</a>s grows around that <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ware, it becomes more and more clear that the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers are in control even if the <a href="virt.htm">virt</a>ual <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es being <a href="use.htm">use</a>d are <a href="free.htm">free</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a> is a <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment originally between the copyright holders <small>(the developers/programmers/<a href="art.htm">art</a>ists)</small>, and finally between all <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect INSTANCE <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers <small>(those <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the media <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to host their <a href="own.htm">own</a> copy)</small> that share with others.<br/>
<br/>
When such <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e occurs, the INSTANCE <a href="own.htm">own</a>er is required to allow that <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="user.htm">user</a> "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" access to the <a href="virt.htm">Virt</a>ual <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of that information.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is fairly trivial for <a href="virt.htm">Virt</a>ual <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es, as the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s are quite small <small>(though never zero)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;But what can we do for the <a href="user.htm">User</a> to gain control of the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion?<br/>
<br/>
I have an <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a about how to go about this, but it is incomplete. Please tell me what you think of the following <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>osal, and how we might merge these <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>as with those of others <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing on creating a physical commons.<br/>
<br/>
The kernel of my <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a is to write a contract that causes any <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e paid above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <small>(what would usually be called <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> to become an investment *from that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er* in more physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es. The consumer that paid "<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" is given a receipt that shows how much he invested <small>(how much <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> he paid)</small> and is also "<a href="title.htm">Title</a> of <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership" for the small a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of beef cattle, wheat and tomato fields, milk dairy, chicken farm, etc. he now <a href="own.htm">own</a>s after <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing for lunch.<br/>
<br/>
This is <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> in at least one respect from for-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> or even non-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> corporations that <a href="use.htm">use</a> that value to 'grow' the business.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence is that the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of that <a href="new.htm">new</a> investment is the consumer who paid.<br/>
<br/>
The investment is made on behalf of the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing consumer so he incrementally begins to have <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <small>(co)</small><a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es required to <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e that <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ective continues to be hosted in the future under the direct but collective control <small>(limited by the <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment of the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of each <a href="real.htm">real</a>istically divisible sub-group)</small> of that very same <a href="user.htm">user</a>. In this way hosting can be large-scale while remaining under consumer control.<br/>
<br/>
The contract would then be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d by any group of consumers that buy physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es for the purpose of "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t instead of attempting to keep <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> hoping to collect <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as some sort of 'reward'.<br/>
<br/>
This perpetuates <a href="user.htm">user</a> <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom through dynamic allocation of physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es as <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership. <a href="new.htm">New</a> <a href="user.htm">user</a>s thus gain <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership when the <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> they <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> becomes their <a href="own.htm">own</a> investment toward more physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es - so that <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e approaches <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> as competition approaches perfection.<br/>
<br/>

Inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s <small>(primarily of labor)</small> who choose the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public license.htm">General Public License</a> <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e every <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect <a href="user.htm">user</a> has <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom in that they gain <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in an instance <small>(copy)</small> of the '<a href="virt.htm">Virt</a>ual' <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="source freedom.htm">Source Freedom</a> generalizes this to <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e the consumer of any kind of <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect <small>(<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t)</small> also gains <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the *Physical* <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion by treating all <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as consumer investment.<br/>
