<br/>
Minimum size and complexity to host the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of basic solutions.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="obj.htm">OBJ</a>ECTIVES are the basic goods and services we all need, such as food, shelter, medical care, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="sourc.htm">SOURC</a>ES are the <a href="land.htm">land</a>, tools, <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>dings, plants, animals, water, etc. needed to create those <a href="obj.htm">OBJ</a>ECTIVES.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="skill.htm">SKILL</a>S are human actions needed to create <a href="obj.htm">OBJ</a>ECTIVES from <a href="sourc.htm">SOURC</a>ES.<br/>

<br/>
<a href="own.htm">OWN</a>ERS are people who control <a href="sourc.htm">SOURC</a>ES.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="work.htm">WORK</a>ERS are people who apply <a href="skill.htm">SKILL</a>S.<br/>
<br/>
We can pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for <a href="obj.htm">OBJ</a>ECTIVES.<br/>
Commit <a href="sourc.htm">SOURC</a>ES and <a href="skill.htm">SKILL</a>S.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;are now the <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers of the <a href="sourc.htm">SOURC</a>ES<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Those <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers receive <a href="co-own.htm">co-Own</a>ership in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> in a form we call "<a href="use.htm">Use</a> Shares" which are similar to full <a href="co-own.htm">co-Own</a>ership, but with some initial limitations on selling or <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ing those Tools or <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="use.htm">Use</a> Shares are <a href="use.htm">use</a>d by the holder to prove that he has the right to <a href="use.htm">use</a> the Tools <small>(limited by schedule)</small> or consume some of the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts <small>(limited by % of holdings within that Unit)</small> of any restaurant, a<a href="part.htm">part</a>ment, bus, hospital, etc. operating within the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers do not buy <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts from the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s, but <a href="own.htm">Own</a> those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts already because of their <a href="use.htm">Use</a> Shares in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> awarded for commitments to <a href="work.htm">Work</a> or from commitments of <a href="land.htm">Land</a> or Capital.<br/>
<br/>
After some a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of time, or after some series of events the <a href="use.htm">Use</a> Shares should vest more fully to the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er to allow for selling and/or <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ing of those <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es or the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts of those <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
Initial stages of development might have some <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>ing in mobile homes and eating food the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> bought in bulk.<br/>
<br/>
Later, after the agriculture is <a href="install.htm">install</a>ed and <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing, the system will become "self hosted", being able to operate without requiring any external inputs.<br/>
<br/>
Soon afterward, the system will be <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing surplus that can be sold to outsiders to collect <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
If Venture Capitalists helped <a href="fund.htm">fund</a> the operation, <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> will be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d as their ROI.<br/>
<br/>
We may want to distribute <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> to the <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers, since that is a <a href="pop.htm">pop</a>ular thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
We may we to distribute <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> to random charities, since that is a <a href="pop.htm">pop</a>ular thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
But we MUST handle some non-zero % of the <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>s as though that overpayment were an investment from the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er.<br/>
<br/>
We should charge <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> during those sales, for if we don't collect the <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, a middle-man will buy all that we offer at <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>, and then resell it for a <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> anyway...<br/>
<br/>
So we will charge <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> against the <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er, but we will also treat <small>(at least <a href="part.htm">part</a> of)</small> that magic value as <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er Investment.<br/>
<br/>
This causes these late-coming <a href="user.htm">user</a>s to slowly gain <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership and therefore to eventually stop buying that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t too.<br/>
<br/>
Similar to how the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> enforces Copy<a href="left.htm">left</a> through Copyright, we <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ose to create a <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty<a href="left.htm">Left</a> document enforced through <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty Rights <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to apply this requirement to the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
This social contract can be applied by <a href="co-own.htm">co-Own</a>ers of any material assets to <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom for all <a href="user.htm">user</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
Notice this is also a literal form of <a href="insur.htm">Insur</a>ance. These <a href="user.htm">user</a>s must cover all the <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion just as any <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers do, but they do not buy the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t since they <a href="own.htm">Own</a> it already - and they don't sell the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t because they need to <a href="use.htm">use</a> it directly.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is not <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ed unless there is surplus, and in that case the <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er must cover all the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion so the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er of <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es can be compensated for <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing when they didn't need to...<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er will usually also <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, according to how much the "market will bear". Some % of that overpayment must be treated as an investment from that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er so the growth of the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> is incrementally autodistributed to all those willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for that growth.<br/>
<br/>
At some point, and under certain constraints, and mostly to resolve disputes, subgroups must finally be allowed to fork from the rest while retaining <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="ecol.htm">Ecol</a>ogically, the system must be able to operate on it's <a href="own.htm">Own</a>, without external inputs.<br/>
<br/>
This is done by the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ing the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of all the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts being <a href="use.htm">use</a>d. Another term for this is "Vertical Integration".<br/>
<br/>
Initially no <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a> will be strictly closed-loop because we will just buy shovels instead of trying to mine Iron ore, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="econ.htm">Econ</a>omically, the system must allow the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s to create value for themselves without <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing external entities.<br/>
<br/>
This is done by helping the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s gain <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership whenever they <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for that growth <small>(usually when <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small>, and to retain that <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership when <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s <small>(usually through <a href="work.htm">work</a>)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
This can be imperfect as well, just so the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er receives *some* <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership - for it is the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership in <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es that eliminates the need to buy <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts. In <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter terminology this is similar to the concepts of "predictive schedule", "pre-cache" or "pre-allocate" because the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t is not moved <small>(sold)</small> at the last moment, but is already the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of the entity that will <a href="use.htm">use</a> it.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine a crowd-<a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ed corporation where the only shareholders are the very Consumers of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
Their ROI for taking risk would be to avoid <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> - since the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er of an Apple tree does not *buy* the Apples from himself, but <a href="own.htm">Own</a>s those <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ectives already, as a side-effect of his <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ing the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
There would no longer be "Vendor/Consumer" relations to worry about since the Vendor and Consumer would be one and the same!<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t would not be sold <a href="back.htm">back</a> to each inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>-Consumer-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>er, but it is already their <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty according to the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> they invested - whether they invested with <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y or with labor.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er of a milk cow does not buy the milk from himself, but <a href="own.htm">Own</a>s it already as a result of his <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ing the cow.<br/>
<br/>
A cooperative SELLS the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t <a href="back.htm">back</a> to the Consumer-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers - thereby collecting !<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>! and coming under the scrutiny of government restrictions <small>(for example it is illegal to sell raw milk in some <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the US)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
In cases where an agent has invested more than he can <a href="use.htm">use</a> directly, he can sell that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t to agents who do not yet have sufficient <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership, but under the strict condition <small>(enforced by a Terms of Operation over that organization)</small> that any <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> collected during that sale be treated as an investment from that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er - so the organization can grow in size while avoiding the troubles of centralization and overaccumulation that plague nearly every other endeavor that even begins to succeed.<br/>
<br/>
There is no reason to worry about the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers - for that is who I am <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ing, but am <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ing their ability to consume instead of trying to <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>-up wages and avoid automation.<br/>
<br/>
Wishing the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hines would just stop <small>(as John Henry)</small> will become less and less of an option as the robots are coming to take the <a href="work.htm">work</a> away - and we can be *happy* about that if we are <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing on the right side of the equation!<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, even without robots, wages and <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> will approach zero as the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion become cheaper, since there will be no way to stop willing <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers from accessing those tools and thereby providing the solutions Consumers seek.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers can invest more than they are able to consume, but it won't do them any good when the Consumers already have sufficient <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership needed to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> themselves from <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers who try to stop other peers from doing that <a href="work.htm">work</a> by blocking access to the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers cannot <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> wages through <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership if other Consumers already have sufficient <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership because <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ping wages requires the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er be able to STOP other potential <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers from accessing the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion, and why would a group stop a peer from bidding to do a <a href="job.htm">job</a> - in some cases even for <a href="free.htm">free</a> <small>(gratis)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers who invest and <a href="co-own.htm">co-Own</a> more of the Apple orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> than they are able to consume will not be able to <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>-up wages because the other <a href="co-own.htm">co-Own</a>ers will always have the option to do the <a href="work.htm">work</a> for themselves or to hire the lowest bidder.<br/>
<br/>
When the Consumers around those <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers have sufficient <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership, they will not be buying the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t from anyone, but will <a href="own.htm">Own</a> it already as a side-effect of their <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ing the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of those <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ectives.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You may be tempted to dismiss this as simply a Consumer Cooperative, but this is absolutely NOT a Consumer Cooperative.<br/>
<br/>
1,)</small> Consumer Cooperatives *sell* the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t <a href="back.htm">back</a> to the <a href="co-own.htm">co-Own</a>ers and collect a <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> during that transaction that a committee then doles out in a Tyranny of the Majority fashion.<br/>
<br/>
1a.)</small> <a href="imput.htm">Imput</a>ed <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion only sells <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t to non-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers, and only when there is surplus, and treats that <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as an investment from that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er - causing <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership and control to be automatically distributed at the point of sale <a href="back.htm">back</a> to the actor who was willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for it. This system minimizes and nearly eliminates the <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ing of goods since the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er of <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es does not buy the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ective, but <a href="own.htm">Own</a>s it already as a result of his <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ing the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es. The <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ing of goods will tend toward zero but does not reach stasis because of newcomers into the system <small>(even just babies being born)</small>, and because people's interests change across time.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> Consumer Cooperatives are "Democratically Controlled" with one-member/one-vote.<br/>
<br/>
2a.)</small> <a href="imput.htm">Imput</a>ed <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion is far more autarchic- where any member can "fork" his portion of the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es and secede from the union or sell those shares if a split is attempted that is finer than reasonable divisibility <small>(you can't both feed a single milk-cow grain and NOT feed that cow grain, but can divide a herd)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
2b.)</small> Each member has exactly as much vote power as he has <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership. If you <a href="own.htm">Own</a> 11% of a roto-tiller and your neighbor <a href="own.htm">Own</a>s 22%, then you have only half as much vote power in decisions such as "how often should we change the oil".<br/>
<br/>
3.)</small> Every Consumer Cooperative I <a href="know.htm">know</a> of is only concerned with buying <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts that were made by Capitalists.<br/>
<br/>
3a.)</small> <a href="imput.htm">Imput</a>ed <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion is primarily about <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership and control of the entire tree of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion - recursively, and <a href="work.htm">work</a>s toward a Vertically Integrated Commons where we, the people, <a href="own.htm">Own</a> the farms and factories and <a href="land.htm">land</a> and water rights and all the other <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es and supporting <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es required to re<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e those things.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We don't need to transform politicians, and do not have enough <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y to buy such changes anyway.<br/>
<br/>
All we need to do is <a href="start.htm">start</a> businesses that are <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ed and <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ed by Consumers and that treat <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er investment.<br/>
<br/>
Consumers *already* <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion. We, the Consumers, foot the entire bill. And we *also* <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> because we choose to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> late.<br/>
<br/>
But if we could organize to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> early - to collectively purchase the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts and services we need - then, we would still need to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
But since we would <a href="own.htm">Own</a> the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ective as a side-effect of our <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ing the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es, we would not BUY from ourselves, and so COULD NOT <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, for that final transaction would not even occur!<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is UNDEFINED when the Consumers are the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers of the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Instead of taking a stance through <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership, we beg and plead the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers to "please do the right thing" - even though the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers have NO POSSIBLE CHANCE of doing the right thing, for they owe Inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s who expect <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e be kept above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e can only be kept above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> <small>(<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> only occurs)</small> during Scarcity.<br/>
<br/>
The drive for Scarcity is caused by choosing inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s who expect <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as a return and can be eliminated by choosing inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s who expect <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t as a return.<br/>
<br/>
But only Consumers can <a href="use.htm">use</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t as a return.<br/>
<br/>
So the answer is to attract Consumers to pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t - while using those pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ments as actual investments which are then <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="co-own.htm">co-Own</a>ed by those Consumers who benefit from the <a href="use.htm">use</a>-value of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, and never need strive for Scarcity, for the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t will usually never be sold.<br/>
<br/>
In the case where a Consumer-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>er has too much <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t: the solution is to sell that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t to non-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers, and even to charge <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> <small>(<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>)</small> against those late comers *BUT* - here is the trick - the <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> received must be treated as though that Consumer had just made an investment toward even more Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
Treating <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er's investment will allow the collective to include others while simultaneously avoiding the typical problems of overaccumulation and excessive concentration of control that cause even the most well-intentioned organizations to finally fail to meet the needs of those they were initially formed to serve <small>(the Consumers of course!)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
This is somewhat like a "short circuit" across the typical market.<br/>
<br/>
Where the Consumers do not buy the finished goods, but <a href="own.htm">Own</a> them already - even before they are completed - as a side-effect of their <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership in the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of those goods.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you <a href="own.htm">Own</a> an Apple tree, you do not *buy* the apples from yourself.<br/>
<br/>
If you and your neighbor <a href="co-own.htm">co-Own</a> an Apple, you need not *buy* the apples from your collective "self.<br/>
<br/>
If you 999 other people <a href="co-own.htm">co-Own</a> an Apple orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a>, you need not *buy* the apples from your collective "self".<br/>
<br/>
This has other benefits such as:<br/>
1.)</small> Since the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is not sold, there is no chance for the government to collect sales tax.<br/>
2.)</small> Since the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is not sold, there is no chance for the government to disallow that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <small>(buying raw milk is illegal in many <a href="part.htm">part</a>s of the US)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty taxes if we qualify as a non-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
