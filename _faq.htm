Q: What is this all about?<br/>
A: Incorporation <small>(as in "the creation of a <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive body")</small> is the original and only valid purpose of government, but consumers and citizens lose control over time because divisible <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es does not flow to those who <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es or taxes above the <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ing those <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ectives.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q: So you are saying corporations should take over the government?&nbsp;&nbsp;You're a bit late.&nbsp;&nbsp;They're already in control!<br/>
A: Well, we must <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> corporations that treat any <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> as an investment from the <a href="user.htm">user</a> that paid it so every consumer becomes <a href="part.htm">part</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>er in the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es required for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once that is running, and once we have a <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency <a href="back.htm">back</a>ed by <small>(issued against)</small> those physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, then allowing <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y to buy votes will not be a problem, as it will simply be each <a href="own.htm">own</a>er exerting the weight they acheived as measured by others in the community that were willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for the <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s that person offered.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q: What's the big deal about <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership?<br/>
A: <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers rule.&nbsp;&nbsp;Private <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty already <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>es privacy, but humans also need public <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty to maximize their <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic efficiency.&nbsp;&nbsp;Representative government is one way to manage joint holdings, and collective private <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is another way.&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantage of collective private <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is the opportunity for the initial inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s to add any constraint as a "Term of <a href="use.htm">Use</a>" for that <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty while retaining full control.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q: Constraint?&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you saying <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom must be restricted?<br/>
A: It is power that must be bridled so that <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom and abundance can grow through cooperation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Usury <small>(misdirected <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> relies upon <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity through power to concentrate larger individual gains while retarding communal growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the same pattern described by the Nash Equilibrium and can be resolved through a legally binding inter-<a href="own.htm">own</a>er <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment that <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>es each consumer grows according to the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> they are willing to invest as measured by the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <small>(<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> that they <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q: The market has already chosen capitalism.<br/>
A: The same could be said of feudalism during that age.&nbsp;&nbsp;The future will prove or disprove the point, but only if we can get <a href="boot.htm">boot</a>ed.&nbsp;&nbsp;An <a href="ecocom.htm">ecocom</a>ics simulation could also help verify or disprove the claim.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q: What do you mean '<a href="boot.htm">boot</a>ed'?<br/>
A: There must be some initial investment in physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es by those who are willing to apply this contract.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q: What claim is being made?&nbsp;&nbsp;That an <a href="own.htm">own</a>er can apply arbitrary restrictions to their <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty?<br/>
A: The claim is that <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom is determined by access to <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es and that access is determined by <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of condemning private <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, we show how it may be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to apply an <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment that <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>es the plea for growth <small>(a consumer's <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment of <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> = what is usually called <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> is treated as an investment from that very same <a href="user.htm">user</a> - so control remains in <small>(flows to)</small> the hands of the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s, even while their choices and membership are dynamic.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q: Isn't scarcity an integral <a href="part.htm">part</a> of a vibrant <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omy?<br/>
A: Scarcity only increases <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>, never wages nor <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.&nbsp;&nbsp;Treating <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as <a href="user.htm">user</a> investment removes that faulty incentive from <a href="own.htm">own</a>er options while very likely increasing wage since the consumer already <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s wages + <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> in normal capitalism, while this contract drives <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> toward zero as <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e meets <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q: But who will invest without <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>?<br/>
A: Citizens already invest in public utilities through taxes expecting only <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, never <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, commercial <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t consumers also expect <small>(and receive)</small> only <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t while <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing those <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s plus the externality of usury.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q: Why are you trying to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> the consumer instead of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er?<br/>
A: We are all consumers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q: But how can you claim <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers won't be exploited when they are not the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, and therefore have no control?<br/>
A: Those <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers are also consumers of their <a href="own.htm">own</a> needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;We must <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> their ability to consume, but <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing is not a need in itself - it is a hurdle to be eliminated on our road to leisure.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q: Are you claiming un<a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ment is good?<br/>
A: When the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es are the only consumers of those <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects there is never a concern about automating that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion because to do so only decreases the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion while eliminate the drudgery of <a href="work.htm">work</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers are a random set of initial inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s seeking to keep <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as some sort of reward, the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers become human re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es to be exploited as though they were just another input of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q: We already have competition; there are no true monopolys.<br/>
A: It is true that monopoly is rarely perfect, but neither is competition.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> also measures monopoly, otherwise why would a consumer ever <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> more than <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q: If <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is the problem, then why do non-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>s not prevail?<br/>
A: The <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is not a problem in itself, as it is simply an inverse measure of development.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> should be allowed; it is only the misapplication of that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment that keeps each <a href="user.htm">user</a> from growing.&nbsp;&nbsp;The trouble is a general form of usury caused by the misap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riation of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> by <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers which then constructs the inverted incentive of <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-<a href="profit.htm">profit</a> corporations do not solve this problem either because the <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> is still not treated as <a href="user.htm">user</a> investment, but is instead "turned into" wages or invested by the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers in whatever way they see fit as so-called 'representatives' of the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s instead of control flowing to those <a href="user.htm">user</a>s as <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership which would allow them to replace board members that attempted to overpay themselves and also implements direct democracy with vote weighted by holdings.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q: May I charge <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y for <a href="free.htm">Free</a> <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects?<br/>
A: Yes, the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public law.htm">General Public Law</a> is a <span class="quot">"'commercial grade'"</span> <a href="free.htm">free</a> <small>(as in <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom)</small> <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q: How much may I charge?<br/>
A: There is no limit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some sort of auction system might help maximize re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e utilization to keep <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>es above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> only during high demand.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q: As an <a href="own.htm">own</a>er, how much of the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e can I claim as <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s <small>(including wages)</small>?<br/>
A: There is no limit.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is separated from wages as the number of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers per physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e increases.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers are then hired by the collecitve <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers explicitly instead of the labor being 'assumed' by some of the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers who may otherwise overpay themselves.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q: Can I apply the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public law.htm">General Public Law</a> to a physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e such as a rototiller and then <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> it to customers?<br/>
A: Yes, in this case the '<a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect' becomes the ephemeral '<a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ective' of that <a href="user.htm">User</a> or the rivalrous slice of time as the duration of that <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing <a href="user.htm">user</a>s to bid against each other for time slots will maximize <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> <small>(the winning <a href="user.htm">user</a>'s investment)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q: So if a car factory were under such a contract, anyone could just wander in off the street and try to <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d their <a href="own.htm">own</a> automobile?<br/>
A: No, no.&nbsp;&nbsp;Shareholders will <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> their investments from strangers and/or vandals and normal wear as usual by requiring a <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> floor be paid - even if the <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>er is a <a href="part.htm">part</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>er, and may also require such things as tests or <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance to qualify.&nbsp;&nbsp;The restrictions each group of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers impose over that <a href="part.htm">part</a>icular physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e are arbitrary and there is no limit, but the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency issued against those physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es will decrease as non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ing <a href="user.htm">user</a>s assess those <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects as being not worth the claimed <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q: Why are you doing this, why not just maximize you <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>?<br/>
A: Because if we don't stop these <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>eering feudalists they will eventually hire vassals to come take all of our re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es for the purpose of stopping our <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the ultimate problem with allowing any form of usury: it finally creates war to destroy capital for the purpose of further increasing usury.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q: Why would <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers tie their <a href="own.htm">own</a> hands in this way to forgo <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>?<br/>
A: So the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <small>(such as <a href="land.htm">land</a>, water, plants, animals, <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>dings, tools)</small> that they need for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion are available to them without <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing tribute to another.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e we <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom through cooperation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q: But isn't <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> the prime motivator of human society?<br/>
A: <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t is the only valid purpose of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.&nbsp;&nbsp;A portion of <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e, interest and <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> are initially meaningful and <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful for reclaiming the labor expended, re<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es lent or opportunity lost, but these are almost always taken to far, and at the instant that an <a href="own.htm">own</a>er is paid just because they won't let the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s have "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" access to the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es, they have begun 'earning' usury.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most humans only expect to get paid for the <a href="work.htm">work</a> they do, but after they begin hiring <a href="employ.htm">employ</a>ees, and as their business grows, the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers usually find there is much to be made <small>(taken)</small> by disallowing <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e access.&nbsp;&nbsp;We must eliminate those externalizing actions before the beast destroys the entire earth in the name of progress.<br/>
