Problem1. Consumers must <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently buy all the goods and services they need because they do not already <a href="own.htm">own</a> those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts.<br/>
<br/>
Solution1. Consumers can avoid this for any <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t they can *predict* they will need by becoming <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers in the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion for that good or service.<br/>
<br/>
For example, the <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of a cow does not buy milk from himself - he <a href="own.htm">own</a>s it already as a side-effect of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the cow.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of a dairy do not need to buy milk from themselves - they <a href="own.htm">own</a> it already as a side-effect of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the cows.<br/>
<br/>
This is a <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified form of crowd-<a href="fund.htm">fund</a>ing where the customers prepay <small>(notice the time reference here)</small> for a <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t and receive <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership in the Means <small>(or Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es)</small> of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
This eliminates <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> because the <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e those people <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> as consumers is exactly the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s they paid as <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers. Surprisingly, this also eliminates sales taxes since there is no transaction for the government to target.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>d time-based problem and solution concerns the elimination of <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional wages:<br/>
<br/>
Problem2. <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers must <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently <a href="work.htm">work</a> for <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y in return for <a href="work.htm">work</a> they do "at will" - meaning they have little commitment to showup for <a href="work.htm">work</a> and are in peril of being arbitrarily fired.<br/>
<br/>
Solution2. <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers can avoid this by cross-committing to <a href="work.htm">work</a> in the *future* in return for those <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>es being treated as <a href="real.htm">real</a> investment and so receive <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership in the Means of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts they need to consume.<br/>
<br/>
By "cross-commit" I mean each <a href="work.htm">work</a>er will <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>e to <a href="work.htm">work</a> in a specific <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <a href="arena.htm">Arena</a> <small>(say milking cows)</small> in return for receiving <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership in many other <a href="part.htm">part</a>s of the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <a href="arena.htm">Arena</a> needed to supply him with all of his basic needs.<br/>
<br/>
I need to refine how I explain this, because there is a bit more to it that I did not include in the above...<br/>
<br/>
Each inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s <small>(whether committing <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y or future labor)</small> will usually receive a 'bundle' of <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty-rights *and* commitments from others to perform the future labor necessary to accomplish that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
For example, the cow-milker would usually receive both <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the dentist office *and* commitments from the dentist to fix his teeth in the future when necessary.<br/>
<br/>
When <a href="use.htm">use</a>d in conjunction these commitments create the kind of security that <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance pretends to deliver. I sometimes call it "life assurance".<br/>

<br/>
And so, to answer the original question of "how to <a href="fund.htm">fund</a> the evolution":<br/>
<br/>
We will attract middle-to-upper-income inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s to supply the <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y to buy these Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es for an advertised return of organic goods and services in the future - though they will actually be receiving <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership in the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <a href="arena.htm">Arena</a>, and receiving the goods and services as a 'side-effect' of that <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership. In this way we eliminate the buying and selling of those goods and services.<br/>
<br/>
And we also attract middle-to-lower-income inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s to cross-commit their *future* labor in return for <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership in the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <a href="arena.htm">Arena</a>. In this way we eliminate the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment of <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional wages.<br/>

Yes, I can definitely see some correlation with Cook's <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el, but I have had a <a href="hard.htm">hard</a> time understanding some of his high-finance lingo, so it is <a href="hard.htm">hard</a> for me to say how close they are.<br/>
<br/>
It would be <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful to see how his <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el would look when applied to a milk dairy as described above; specifically, *who* would be the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, and would the customers be required to buy the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t from those <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I am quite sure of is that he is not trying to solve the s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>d problem of eliminating wages. Eliminating wages is especially complicated because it requires a "<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <a href="arena.htm">Arena</a>" that can supply <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers with their most common needs.<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes call this a "Basic Outcome".<br/>
<br/>
Another, very crucial <a href="part.htm">part</a> of this <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el is similar to something Cook does in his <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el:<br/>
<br/>
1. <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er's investment. This means we will sell surplus to outsiders for a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> <small>(collect <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>)</small> but then immediately invest those extra <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>s on behalf of the consumer who paid them. I think maybe we need to not allow the consumer to immediately "cash out", but am not yet sure how long the waiting period should be or under what conditions the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er becomes the full vested <a href="own.htm">own</a>er, but they must finally gain control of those investments.<br/>
<br/>
Treating <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> as an investment from the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er autodistributes the growth of the organization to those willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for that growth.<br/>
