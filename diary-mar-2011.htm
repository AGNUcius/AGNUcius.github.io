Hmm... Well, I see what you mean, we don't<br/>

to solve.<br/>
<br/>
But we need each a certain a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of control<br/>
over a limited subset of the whole, else we<br/>
won't even be allowed basic personal privacy.<br/>
<br/>
We must <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d a system that can both resist<br/>
overaccumulation that <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ern feudalists seek,<br/>
while retaining the ability to organize for<br/>

<br/>
<a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership has some valuable attributes<br/>
that, if handled carefully, can be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to our<br/>
advantage as a species instead of being <a href="use.htm">use</a>d<br/>
as a tool of domination as it often has been<br/>
by those who have organized before us.<br/>
<br/>
Similar to how the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> <a href="use.htm">use</a>s Copyright to<br/>
create Copy<a href="left.htm">left</a> for the purpose of <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ing<br/>

<br/>
We can write a Terms-of-Operation that we can<br/>
then apply to <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty Rights ... a sort of<br/>
<a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty <a href="left.htm">Left</a> if you will, that will allow us<br/>
to <a href="use.htm">use</a> regular <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership as the basis of a new<br/>
approach to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ing physical assets that we<br/>
might more efficiently hold in common.<br/>
<br/>
I think of it as a "simulated commons" that is<br/>
constructed somewhat <a href="art.htm">art</a>ificially - in that we<br/>
do not wait for a government or corporation to<br/>
finally do the "right thing", but instead <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e<br/>
that action ourselves, in a collective manner.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="part.htm">Part</a> of the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>iculty comes in discovering<br/>
what 'rules' or 'laws' must be included in the<br/>
Terms-of-Operation.<br/>
<br/>
I believe I have found 2 of those rules:<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> Consumers are the inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s who are the<br/>
&nbsp;*<a href="real.htm">real</a>* <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers of those Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion<br/>
&nbsp;and the 'return' is the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t itself which<br/>
&nbsp;they *already <a href="own.htm">own</a>* as a side-effect of their<br/>
&nbsp;<a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of those <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts.&nbsp;&nbsp;This<br/>
&nbsp;creates a truly <a href="use.htm">use</a>-value endeavor.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is treated as <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er Investment.<br/>
&nbsp;This means late-comers <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>,<br/>
&nbsp;but that overpayment is invested *for them*<br/>
&nbsp;in even more Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion - so that<br/>
&nbsp;each <a href="user.htm">User</a>s incrementally gains the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty<br/>
&nbsp;they need to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> them from <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="profit.htm">profit</a><br/>

<br/>
This is not quite what I understand.<br/>
<br/>
The system is so complicated that<br/>
I am not sure whether the following<br/>
is perfectly correct...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I believe the structure is more like:<br/>
<br/>
The Fed is a sort of 'front' for <a href="bank.htm">bank</a>ers<br/>
from all around the world <small>(sometimes<br/>
called "International <a href="bank.htm">Bank</a>ers")</small>.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
In the United <a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>es, these are "Federal<br/>

<br/>
These <a href="bank.htm">bank</a>ers then *BUY* whatever they<br/>
want with this phoney <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y.<br/>
<br/>
One of the most terrifying commodities<br/>
they buy is BONDS.<br/>
<br/>
The reason this is such a problem is<br/>
that many of those BONDS are <a href="back.htm">back</a>ed<br/>
by <a href="land.htm">land</a> such as National Forests and<br/>
other Federal <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ties.<br/>
<br/>
Because of this, we are losing <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership<br/>
of our nations to shysters who *BUY* it<br/>
from us using <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y they created without<br/>
taking any risk whatever.<br/>

Yes, I see what you mean.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've made some<br/>

<br/>
But that is a separate question from whether<br/>

<br/>
I am asking if the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er should gain <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership<br/>
in a tree when he <a href="work.htm">work</a>s on it, even when that<br/>
tree is <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ed by a few neighbors that will<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> theories would say that an individual should</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> not <a href="own.htm">own</a> 100 olive trees.</span><br/>
<br/>
Just to be clear: I am not suggesting a single<br/>
individual should <a href="own.htm">own</a> 100 olive trees.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am<br/>
talking about <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership of 100 olive trees,<br/>
with the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers determined by how<br/>
much <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t they predict they will actually<br/>
<a href="use.htm">use</a> for themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;100 trees might be <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed<br/>
by 150 people, for example, if those people<br/>
don't eat much of that kind of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, or 100<br/>
trees might be <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by only 75 people when<br/>
those <a href="user.htm">user</a>s intend to <a href="use.htm">use</a> alot of that kind<br/>

<br/>
The <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a is to help <a href="user.htm">user</a>s to gain exactly as<br/>

<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t they intend to<br/>
consume within the next round-of-<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I think it would be even better to<br/>
help them <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> just slightly more than they<br/>
predict they will need, so variance in output<br/>
will not leave them in the position where they<br/>
will need to buy the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t from somewhere<br/>
else - thereby suffering the <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment of <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In cases where the output is more than that<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>er can <a href="use.htm">use</a> directly, they should be able to<br/>
do whatever they want with that extra <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t,<br/>
even including *selling* it to <a href="user.htm">user</a>s who do<br/>
not yet have enough <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>

<br/>
Hmm...&nbsp;&nbsp;I see.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think this oversight on my <a href="part.htm">part</a><br/>
does not invalidate the question in general.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For example, what if I <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed the tools to perform the<br/>
service, but hired someone to do the <a href="work.htm">work</a>?<br/>
<br/>
Let's say I <a href="own.htm">own</a> the cable-splicer and whatever else<br/>
equipment a <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> technician would need, and he<br/>
<a href="use.htm">use</a>d that equipment to <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> my house.<br/>
<br/>
Should he then become <a href="part.htm">part</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of those tools?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What if I <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed all the wrenches and other things<br/>
needed to fix my car, or <a href="install.htm">install</a> plumbing but hired<br/>
someone else to do the <a href="work.htm">work</a>?<br/>
<br/>
Should he then become <a href="part.htm">part</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of those tools?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If he <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed his <a href="own.htm">own</a> tools <small>(the same as the ones I<br/>
was offering)</small>, notice he would not be able to stop<br/>
other potential <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers for reverse-bidding for that<br/>
<a href="job.htm">job</a> - even when those other <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers did not <a href="own.htm">own</a><br/>
tools themselves, because I would allow those non-<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ing <a href="work.htm">work</a>er to access my tools "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>".&nbsp;&nbsp;His<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership would not help him except in cases where<br/>
he was vying for a <a href="job.htm">job</a> from a customer that did NOT<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a> those tools.<br/>
<br/>
I would be '<a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ed' through my <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the<br/>
Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion from being forced to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> more<br/>
than lowest wage any <a href="work.htm">work</a>er would offer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This seems to indicate that competition between<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>ers is maximized when consumers <a href="own.htm">own</a> the Means<br/>
of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
This minimizes Wages and causes <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> to be undefined.<br/>

<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>er <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership is a very widely accepted as<br/>
being the obvious answer to wage slavery.<br/>
<br/>
It is said that <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers must have at least *some*<br/>
<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership in the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion lest they<br/>
otherwise be exploited by those <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But when the situation is on a very small scale,<br/>
the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a seems to break-down and become almost<br/>
absurd - for would you have a <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> technician<br/>
become <a href="part.htm">part</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of your home <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> because<br/>
you hire him to <a href="install.htm">install</a> some wires and configure<br/>
your router?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let's try "stepping through" the logic of this - the way<br/>
a programmer might "step through" a program as he<br/>
is trying to debug what, *exactly* is wrong, and so<br/>
what *exactly* must change.<br/>
<br/>
We will do this by reducing the scale to just one<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>er, and then slowly increasing the scale...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine you <a href="own.htm">own</a> a single Olive tree.<br/>
<br/>
You <a href="pic.htm">pic</a>k the fruit yourself and turn some of them<br/>
into oil - all for your <a href="own.htm">own</a>, personal <a href="use.htm">use</a>.<br/>
<br/>
You <a href="use.htm">use</a> all of the outputs of that tree and you do<br/>
all of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
One day you slip and hurt your <a href="back.htm">back</a>. You can no<br/>
longer <a href="pic.htm">pic</a>k the Olives, but the <a href="work.htm">work</a> must be done.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you hire someone to <a href="work.htm">work</a> for you, should that<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>er have some <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in your personal tree?<br/>
<br/>
If yes, then should the mechanic that fixes your<br/>
car become also <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>er of that vehicle?<br/>
<br/>
What about a plumber that fixes your pipes?<br/>
Should he become <a href="part.htm">part</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of your home?<br/>
<br/>
What if you hire someone to fix your laptop?<br/>
Should he become a stakeholder of that device?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why do these questions seem illogical?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What if the Olive tree is <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ed by you and your<br/>
neighbor?&nbsp;&nbsp;What if an orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> is <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ed by 10<br/>
people?&nbsp;&nbsp;What if by 100?&nbsp;&nbsp;And 1,000?&nbsp;&nbsp;1,000,000?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The same of the other questions.<br/>
<br/>
What if the car is <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ed by 2 people?&nbsp;&nbsp;3 people?<br/>
4, 5, 6, 7, etc...<br/>
<br/>
What if the house has more than one <a href="own.htm">own</a>er?&nbsp;&nbsp;What<br/>
if it is an a<a href="part.htm">part</a>ment complex?<br/>
<br/>
What if the laptop is a massive datacenter?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When does the answer to the question of "Should<br/>
the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er have <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion"<br/>
switch from "Obviously NO" to "Obviously YES"?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But maybe this is simply the wrong question.<br/>
<br/>
What am I missing here?&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should the end-<a href="user.htm">user</a><br/>
retain full <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in some cases, and under<br/>
what circumstances should the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers become<br/>
shareholders?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I suspect it has something to do with whether the<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers are using the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t directly as compared<br/>

<br/>
When the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is <a href="use.htm">use</a>d directly, it seems we do<br/>
not have a problem with the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s retaining <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership<br/>
of their trees, cars, houses, etc.<br/>
<br/>
But if those <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers intend to *sell* some of the<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, then I think we feel the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers then<br/>
deserve <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> that will likely be<br/>
collected from those buyers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So when <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion is <a href="imput.htm">Imput</a>ed - where the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers<br/>
of the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <a href="use.htm">use</a> all of the outputs<br/>
of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion and nothing is sold - it seems<br/>
under that condition, that <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers do not need<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership ... since I guess it would do them no<br/>
good anyway.<br/>
<br/>
When the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers do not sell the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, there is no<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> to divide-up.<br/>
<br/>
Also, when all <a href="user.htm">user</a>-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers have sufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in<br/>
the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion, the usual tactic of stopping<br/>
other <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers from accessing those Means <small>(to increase<br/>
wages)</small> cannot be achieved by <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers gaining <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership<br/>
for themselves, for when the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s have sufficient<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership, they can allow any <a href="work.htm">work</a>er to reverse-bid<br/>
for that <a href="job.htm">job</a>.<br/>

<span class="quot">> of that value</span><br/>
<br/>
This approach is a very heartfelt and widely accepted<br/>
as being the obvious answer to wage slavery.<br/>
<br/>
But let's "step through" the logic of this by<br/>
reducing the scale to just one <a href="own.htm">own</a>er, and then slowly<br/>
increasing the size of the operation...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine you <a href="own.htm">own</a> a single Olive tree.<br/>
<br/>
You <a href="pic.htm">pic</a>k the fruit yourself and turn some of them<br/>
into oil - all for your <a href="own.htm">own</a>, personal <a href="use.htm">use</a>.<br/>
<br/>
You <a href="use.htm">use</a> all of the outputs of that tree and you do<br/>
all of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
One day you slip and hurt your <a href="back.htm">back</a>. You can no<br/>
longer <a href="pic.htm">pic</a>k the Olives, but the <a href="work.htm">work</a> must be done.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you hire someone to <a href="work.htm">work</a> for you, should that<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>er have some <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in your personal tree?<br/>
<br/>
If yes, then should the mechanic that fixes your<br/>
car become also <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>er of that vehicle?<br/>
<br/>
What about a plumber that fixes your pipes?<br/>
Should he become <a href="part.htm">part</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>er of your home?<br/>
<br/>
What if you hire someone to fix your laptop?<br/>
Should he become a stakeholder of that device?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why do these questions seem illogical?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What if the Olive tree is <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ed by you and your<br/>
neighbor?&nbsp;&nbsp;What if an orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> is <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ed by 10<br/>
people?&nbsp;&nbsp;What if by 100?&nbsp;&nbsp;And 1,000?&nbsp;&nbsp;1,000,000?<br/>
<br/>
The same of the other questions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What if the car is <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ed by 2 people?&nbsp;&nbsp;3 people?<br/>
4, 5, 6, 7, etc...<br/>
<br/>
What if the house has more than one <a href="own.htm">own</a>er?&nbsp;&nbsp;What<br/>
if it is an a<a href="part.htm">part</a>ment complex?<br/>
<br/>
What if the laptop is a massive datacenter?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When does the question of "Should the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er have<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion" switch from<br/>
"Obviously NO" to "Obviously YES"?<br/>

Hi Michel,<br/>
<br/>
I write to you in private because I want to avoid<br/>
"calling you out" on the list, but value your input<br/>
on this important topic.<br/>
<br/>
Sepp seems to be saying the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers will be fine<br/>
without the need for <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership beyond that of <a href="use.htm">use</a>.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if you could respond to this?<br/>
<br/>
I <a href="know.htm">know</a> you are not alone; millions of people feel<br/>
<a href="work.htm">work</a>er <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership is vital to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ing those agents<br/>
from exploitation.<br/>
<br/>
But I think there is a chance the reasoning may not<br/>
be very well thought-out.<br/>
<br/>
It is <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult to get people to talk about things<br/>
when they think the answers are so 'obvious' that<br/>
they need no consideration.<br/>
<br/>
Please try to tell us exactly why the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers would<br/>
want <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the context of the scenario of a<br/>
<a href="user.htm">user</a>-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ed <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever I become confused about how to reason<br/>
through some <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the question, I find it <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful<br/>
to bring the scale of the organization down to<br/>
smaller and smaller sizes - with the number of<br/>
<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers at '1' being the '<a href="ide.htm">ide</a>ntity' value.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, if you hired someone to fix the<br/>
<a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> in your home, would you say that <a href="work.htm">work</a>er<br/>
should receive <a href="part.htm">part</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in your <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time,<br/>
Patrick<br/>

<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine you have several <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ters within your<br/>

<br/>
You are not connecting to anything outside of your<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
You must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all of these initial <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s, and continue<br/>

<br/>
Now, there is no reason for each of you to *buy* that<br/>

the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s and that is it.<br/>

This very much applies to this list if we intend to collectively <a href="own.htm">own</a><br/>

<br/>
We, the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s, can invest to <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> wires, cables, satellites, etc.<br/>

<br/>
So it is trivial to see that we could collectively afford to do so,<br/>
for we already <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for everything anyway, but simply do it a bit late,<br/>
and without being organized for our <a href="own.htm">own</a> purposes.<br/>
<br/>
Some of my thought on this are at <a class="ext" href="http://P2PFoundation.net/User_Owned">http://P2PFoundation.net/User_Owned</a><br/>

''<br/>
The Android Developers Union<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, the members and supporters of the Android Developers Union,<br/>
are fed up with the conditions of the Android Market. We are tired of<br/>
being treated like sharecroppers on Google's digital plantation! We<br/>
have <a href="compile.htm">compile</a>d a list of seven demands which Google can implement to<br/>
improve the Market. Implementing these demands will absolutely improve<br/>
the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing conditions for Android developers, thereby improving the<br/>
Android <a href="ecos.htm">ecos</a>ystem and giving a better experience to our customers.<br/>
''<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Notice their approach is the same as <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional unions:&nbsp;&nbsp;To create<br/>
<a href="art.htm">art</a>ificial scarcity of some <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>.<br/>
<br/>
This approach is destined to fail as the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion continues<br/>
to become cheaper.<br/>
<br/>
Wages and <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>s approach zero as Barriers to Entry are reduced.<br/>
<br/>
This applies also to the "<a href="3d.htm">3D</a> Printing" and "Tabletop Manufacturing"<br/>
phenomenon - since, when *anyone* can manufacture some thing, there is<br/>
no longer any way to <a href="prop.htm">prop</a> Wages, and the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e and<br/>
<a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> will be meaningless <small>(<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is undefined when Consumers <a href="own.htm">own</a> the<br/>
Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
The only viable approach I can see is to begin <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ing the "other<br/>
side of the equation" -> meaning, we must <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> the <a href="work.htm">Work</a>er's ability<br/>
to Consume by helping them organize to have <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Means of<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion from which they need the Outputs instead of trying to <a href="own.htm">own</a><br/>
the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion for which they happen to have <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s in<br/>
operating.<br/>
<br/>
So, instead of <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers trying to <a href="own.htm">own</a> the factory where they <a href="work.htm">work</a>, they<br/>
instead direct-invest* in things like Milk Dairies, Chicken Farms,<br/>
Avocado Orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a>s, etc. because those are the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of the things<br/>
they actually need, and let the potential Consumers of what they<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e <a href="own.htm">own</a> that factory.<br/>
<br/>
<small>(*)</small> By 'direct-invest' I mean the Consumers would invest to <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> the<br/>
Fields, Farms etc. and be 'paid' <small>(their ROI)</small> in <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t instead of<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> - for the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t would never be sold since it would already be<br/>
the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of those who intend to actually <a href="use.htm">use</a> it.<br/>

<span class="quot">> Hi Patrick</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> we can set up cooperatives :)</small></span><br/>
<br/>
If they are very carefully defined, then we might be able to simply call them 'Cooperatives'.<br/>
<br/>
But most Cooperatives I <a href="know.htm">know</a> of *sell* the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t <a href="back.htm">back</a> to the collective <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers and therefore collect <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> from them!<br/>
<br/>
This causes control to concentrate into the hands of a few - usually a "democratically elected" committee and causes many other subtle problems.<br/>
<br/>
What I describe is a "short circuit" across the typical market.<br/>
<br/>
Where the consumers do not buy the finished goods, but <a href="own.htm">own</a> them already - even before they are completed - as a side-effect of their <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of those goods.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you <a href="own.htm">own</a> an Apple tree, you do not *buy* the apples from yourself.<br/>
<br/>
If you and your neighbor <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> an Apple, you need not *buy* the apples from your collective 'self'.<br/>
<br/>
If you 999 other people <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> an Apple orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a>, you need not *buy* the apples from your collective 'self'.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This has other benefits such as:<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> Since the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is not sold, there is no chance for the government to collect sales tax.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> Since the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is not sold, there is no chance for the government to disallow that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion <small>(buying raw milk is illegal in many <a href="part.htm">part</a>s of the US)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> or gather consumers for bulk buying, such as food <a href="bank.htm">bank</a>s.</span><br/>
Those organizations are not <a href="own.htm">OWN</a>ED by the Consumers, but are instead the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of some well-intentioned person or group that dominates all decisions.<br/>

Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have saved up some <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y now, but have not yet begun because I cannot get a single human on Earth to actually consider the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence I describe - and so nobody understands how what I <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>ose will be any <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> from what has already been attempted.<br/>

And we *also* <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> because we choose to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> late.<br/>

<br/>
But if we could organize to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> early - to collectively<br/>
purchase the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts and services<br/>

of our <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es, we would no be 'buying'<br/>
from ourselves, and so COULD NOT <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>, for that<br/>
final transaction would not even occur!<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is UNDEFINED when the Customers are the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers<br/>
of the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
Why are we so disorganized and/or terrified of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership<br/>
that we leave it up to those that intend to subjugate<br/>
and dominate us?<br/>
<br/>
And instead of taking a stance through <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership,<br/>
we beg and plead with the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers to "please do<br/>
the right thing" - even though the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers have<br/>
NO POSSIBLE CHANCE of "doing the right thing" for they<br/>
owe inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s who expect <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e be kept above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
And <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e can only be kept above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> during Scarcity.<br/>
<br/>
So we see the drive for Scarcity is caused by choosing<br/>
inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s who expect <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as a return.<br/>
<br/>
The drive for Scarcity can be eliminated by choosing<br/>
inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s who expect <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t as a return.<br/>
<br/>
But only Customers can <a href="use.htm">use</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t as a return.<br/>
<br/>
So the answer is to attract Customers to pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t - while using those pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ments as actual<br/>
investments which are then <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ed by those<br/>
Customers who benefit from the <a href="use.htm">use</a>-value of that<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, and never need strive for Scarcity, for<br/>
the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t will usually never be sold.<br/>
<br/>
In the case where a Customer-<a href="own.htm">Own</a>er has too much <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t:<br/>
the solution is to sell that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t to non-<a href="own.htm">own</a>ers, and<br/>
even to charge <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> <small>(<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>)</small> against those<br/>
late comers *BUT* - here is the trick - the <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a><br/>
received must be treated as though that Customer had<br/>
just made an investment toward even more Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.<br/>
<br/>
Treating <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as that <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>er's investment will allow<br/>
the collective to include others while simultaneously<br/>
avoiding the typical problems of overaccumulation<br/>
and excessive concentration of control that cause<br/>
even the most well-intentioned organizations to finally<br/>
fail to meet the needs of those they were initially<br/>
