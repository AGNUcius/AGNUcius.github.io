Copyright <small>(C)</small> 2007->oo Personal Sovereignty Foundation, Inc.<br/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this document, but changing it is not allowed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preamble<br/>
<br/>
The laws for most <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects are designed to take away your <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom to <a href="use.htm">use</a>, <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify, copy and share them.&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast, the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public law.htm">General Public Law</a> is intended to guarantee these <a href="free.htm">free</a>doms for all versions of an <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect--to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e sure it remains <a href="free.htm">free</a> for all its <a href="user.htm">user</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;We, the Personal Sovereignty Foundation, <a href="use.htm">use</a> the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public law.htm">General Public Law</a> for all of our public <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects; it applies also to any other <a href="work.htm">work</a> released this way by its <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can apply it to your <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, too.<br/>
<br/>
When we speak of <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects, we are referring to both <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom and <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our <a href="general public law.htm">General Public Law</a> is designed to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e sure that you have the <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom to <a href="use.htm">Use</a> <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects for any purpose, that you may <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>ify the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect or mix it with other <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects, that you may Copy the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect, and that you may Share the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect or copies of it <small>(and charge for this if you wish)</small>, that you may access the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of this <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect, and that you <a href="know.htm">know</a> you can do these things.<br/>
<br/>
To <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>ify or Share this <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect instance or copies of it.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if you share copies of such an <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect, whether gratis or for a fee, you must <a href="pass.htm">pass</a> on to the recipients the same <a href="free.htm">free</a>doms that you received.&nbsp;&nbsp;You must <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e sure that they, too, receive or can access the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.&nbsp;&nbsp;And you must show them these terms so they <a href="know.htm">know</a> their rights.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers that <a href="use.htm">use</a> the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public law.htm">General Public Law</a> <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> your rights with two steps: <small>(1)</small> assert <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership of the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect, and <small>(2)</small> offer you this private legislation giving you legal permission to <a href="use.htm">Use</a>, <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>ify, Copy and Share it.<br/>
<br/>
For the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers' <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ion, the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> clearly explains that there is no warranty for this <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect.&nbsp;&nbsp;For both <a href="user.htm">user</a>s' and <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers' sake, the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> requires that <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of previous versions.<br/>
<br/>
Some <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects are designed to deny <a href="user.htm">user</a>s access to <a href="install.htm">install</a> or run <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>amentally incompatible with the aim of <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ing <a href="user.htm">user</a>s' <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom to change the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect.&nbsp;&nbsp;The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects for individuals to <a href="use.htm">use</a>, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we have designed this version of the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> to prohibit the practice for those <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects.&nbsp;&nbsp;If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a>, as needed to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> the <a href="free.htm">free</a>dom of <a href="user.htm">user</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, every <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect is threatened constantly by software patents.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="stat.htm">Stat</a>es should not allow patents to restrict development and <a href="use.htm">use</a> of <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect could <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e it effectively <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>rietary.&nbsp;&nbsp;To prevent this, the <a href="gpl.htm">GPL</a> assures that patents cannot be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to render the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect non-<a href="free.htm">free</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public law.htm">General Public Law</a> is a <a href="free.htm">free</a>, <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="left.htm">left</a> contract for any <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ective and for the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es needed to <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>e the future <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of that <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ective.<br/>
<br/>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ification follow.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
To “<a href="use.htm">Use</a>” an <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect usually means to <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of that <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect for some time or to buy the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect without a time limit.<br/>
<br/>
To “<a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>ify” an <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect means to copy from or adapt all or <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> in a fashion requiring <a href="own.htm">own</a>er permission, other than the <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing of an exact copy.&nbsp;&nbsp;The resulting <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect is called a “<a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified version” of the earlier <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect or an <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect “based on” the earlier <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect.<br/>
<br/>
To "Copy" an <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect usually means to <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> exclusive access the to the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of that <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect for some period of time and to operate those <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es for the purpose of creating <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect instances.<br/>
<br/>
"Exclusive" generally implies privacy unless explicitly <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ed in the list of additional terms, as provided in sub<a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 7b.&nbsp;&nbsp;Copying includes doing anything with the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect or it's <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es that requires permission under any applicable copyright, <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty law, patent law, Treaties or <a href="agree.htm">Agree</a>ments.&nbsp;&nbsp;This applies only to copies you <a href="use.htm">use</a> in <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.&nbsp;&nbsp;"<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion" includes copying, distribution <small>(with or without <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ification)</small>, <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br/>
<br/>
To "Share" an <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect means any action which causes the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect to be made available to another <a href="user.htm">User</a> in any form or capacity of access that enables other <a href="part.htm">part</a>ies to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e or receive copies, excluding subleasing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharing includes the actions:&nbsp;&nbsp;display, host, perform, project, relay, <a href="remot.htm">remot</a>e control, <a href="rent.htm">rent</a>, sell, serve, share, <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e, transfer, transmit, transport.<br/>
<br/>
A “covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>” means either the unmodified <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty or a <a href="work.htm">work</a> based on the <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
To “<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agate” a <a href="work.htm">work</a> means to do anything with it that, without permission, would <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e you directly or s<a href="econ.htm">econ</a>darily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter or <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ifying a private copy.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="prop.htm">Prop</a>agation includes copying, distribution <small>(with or without <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ification)</small>, <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br/>
<br/>
To “convey” a <a href="work.htm">work</a> means any kind of <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agation that enables other <a href="part.htm">part</a>ies to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e or receive copies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mere interaction with a <a href="user.htm">user</a> through a <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ter <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br/>
<br/>
An interactive <a href="user.htm">user</a> interface displays “Ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that <small>(1)</small> displays an ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riate copyright notice, and <small>(2)</small> tells the <a href="user.htm">user</a> that there is no warranty for the <a href="work.htm">work</a> <small>(except to the extent that warranties are provided)</small>, that contractees may convey the <a href="work.htm">work</a> under this Contract, and how to view a copy of this Contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the interface presents a list of <a href="user.htm">user</a> commands or options, such as a <a href="menu.htm">menu</a>, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br/>
1. <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e Code.<br/>
<br/>
The “<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code” for a <a href="work.htm">work</a> means the preferred form of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> for <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ifications to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;“<a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect code” means any non-<a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e form of a <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a <a href="part.htm">part</a>icular <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>tyming language, one that is widely <a href="use.htm">use</a>d among developers <a href="work.htm">work</a>ing in that language.<br/>
<br/>
The “System <a href="lib.htm">Lib</a>raries” of an executable <a href="work.htm">work</a> include anything, other than the <a href="work.htm">work</a> as a whole, that <small>(a)</small> is included in the normal form of <a href="pack.htm">pack</a>aging a Major Component, but which is not <a href="part.htm">part</a> of that Major Component, and <small>(b)</small> serves only to enable <a href="use.htm">use</a> of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code form.&nbsp;&nbsp;A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component <small>(kernel, window system, and so on)</small> of the specific <a href="operating system.htm">operating system</a> <small>(if any)</small> on which the executable <a href="work.htm">work</a> runs, or a <a href="compile.htm">compile</a>r <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e the <a href="work.htm">work</a>, or an <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code interpreter <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to run it.<br/>
<br/>
The “Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e” for a <a href="work.htm">work</a> in <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code form means all the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code needed to generate, <a href="install.htm">install</a>, and <small>(for an executable <a href="work.htm">work</a>)</small> run the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code and to <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify the <a href="work.htm">work</a>, including scripts to control those activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it does not include the <a href="work.htm">work</a>'s System <a href="lib.htm">Lib</a>raries, or general-purpose tools or generally available <a href="free.htm">free</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>tys which are <a href="use.htm">use</a>d unmodified in performing those activities but which are not <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e includes interface definition <a href="file.htm">file</a>s associated with <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="file.htm">file</a>s for the <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and the <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code for shared <a href="lib.htm">lib</a>raries and dynamically linked sub<a href="proper.htm">proper</a>tys that the <a href="work.htm">work</a> is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those sub<a href="proper.htm">proper</a>tys and other <a href="part.htm">part</a>s of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e need not include anything that <a href="user.htm">user</a>s can regenerate automatically from other <a href="part.htm">part</a>s of the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e.<br/>
<br/>
The Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e for a <a href="work.htm">work</a> in <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code form is that same <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
2. Basic Permissions.<br/>
<br/>
All rights granted under this Contract are granted for the term of copyright on the <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty, and are irrevocable provided the <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ed conditions are met.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Contract explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty.&nbsp;&nbsp;The output from running a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> is covered by this Contract only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Contract ac<a href="know.htm">know</a>ledges your rights of fair <a href="use.htm">use</a> or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br/>
<br/>
You may <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e, run and <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agate covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>s that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your contract otherwise remains in force.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may convey covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>s to others for the sole purpose of having them <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those <a href="work.htm">work</a>s, provided that you comply with the terms of this Contract in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those thus <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing or running the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>s for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br/>
<br/>
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ed below.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sublicensing is not allowed; <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 10 <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es it unnecessary.<br/>
3. <a href="protect.htm">Protect</a>ing <a href="user.htm">User</a>s' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br/>
<br/>
No covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> shall be deemed <a href="part.htm">part</a> of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under <a href="art.htm">art</a>icle 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.<br/>
<br/>
When you convey a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this Contract with respect to the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ification of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> as a means of enforcing, against the <a href="work.htm">work</a>'s <a href="user.htm">user</a>s, your or third <a href="part.htm">part</a>ies' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.<br/>
4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br/>
<br/>
You may convey verbatim copies of the <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty's <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riately publish on each copy an ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riate copyright notice; keep intact all notices <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ing that this Contract and any non-permissive terms added in accord with <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this Contract along with the <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
You may charge any <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e or no <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ion for a fee.<br/>
5. Conveying <a href="mod.htm">Mod</a>ified <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e Versions.<br/>
<br/>
You may convey a <a href="work.htm">work</a> based on the <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty, or the <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ifications to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e it from the <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty, in the form of <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code under the terms of <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * a)</small> The <a href="work.htm">work</a> must carry prominent notices <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ing that you <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified it, and giving a relevant date.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * b)</small> The <a href="work.htm">work</a> must carry prominent notices <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ing that it is released under this Contract and any conditions added under <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;This requirement <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ifies the requirement in <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 4 to “keep intact all notices”.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * c)</small> You must offer the entire <a href="work.htm">work</a>, as a whole, under this Contract to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Contract will therefore apply, along with any applicable <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 7 additional terms, to the whole of the <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and all its <a href="part.htm">part</a>s, regardless of how they are <a href="pack.htm">pack</a>aged.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Contract gives no permission to <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e the <a href="work.htm">work</a> in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * d)</small> If the <a href="work.htm">work</a> has interactive <a href="user.htm">user</a> interfaces, each must display Ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riate Legal Notices; however, if the <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty has interactive interfaces that do not display Ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riate Legal Notices, your <a href="work.htm">work</a> need not <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e them do so.<br/>
<br/>
A compilation of a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> with other separate and independent <a href="work.htm">work</a>s, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, in or on a volume of a <a href="stor.htm">stor</a>age or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's <a href="user.htm">user</a>s beyond what the individual <a href="work.htm">work</a>s permit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Inclusion of a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> in an aggregate does not cause this Contract to apply to the other <a href="part.htm">part</a>s of the aggregate.<br/>
6. Conveying Non-<a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e Forms.<br/>
<br/>
You may convey a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> in <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code form under the terms of <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ions 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine-readable Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e under the terms of this Contract, in one of these ways:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * a)</small> Convey the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code in, or embodied in, a physical <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t <small>(including a physical distribution medium)</small>, accompanied by the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e fixed on a durable physical medium customarily <a href="use.htm">use</a>d for software interchange.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * b)</small> Convey the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code in, or embodied in, a physical <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t <small>(including a physical distribution medium)</small>, accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare <a href="part.htm">part</a>s or customer support for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el, to give anyone who possesses the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code either <small>(1)</small> a copy of the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e for all the software in the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t that is covered by this Contract, on a durable physical medium customarily <a href="use.htm">use</a>d for software interchange, for a <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e no more than your reasonable <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> of physically performing this conveying of <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e, or <small>(2)</small> access to copy the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e from a <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> server at no charge.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * c)</small> Convey individual copies of the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code with such an offer, in accord with sub<a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 6b.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * d)</small> Convey the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code by offering access from a designated place <small>(gratis or for a charge)</small>, and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e in the same way through the same place at no further charge.&nbsp;&nbsp;You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e along with the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the place to copy the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code is a <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> server, the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e may be on a <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> server <small>(operated by you or a third <a href="part.htm">part</a>y)</small> that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code saying where to find the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * e)</small> Convey the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code and Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> are being offered to the general public at no charge under sub<a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 6d.<br/>
<br/>
A separable portion of the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code, whose <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code is excluded from the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e as a System <a href="lib.htm">Lib</a>rary, need not be included in conveying the <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code <a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
A “<a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t” is either <small>(1)</small> a “consumer <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t”, which means any tangible personal <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty which is normally <a href="use.htm">use</a>d for personal, family, or household purposes, or <small>(2)</small> anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining whether a <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is a consumer <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;For a <a href="part.htm">part</a>icular <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t received by a <a href="part.htm">part</a>icular <a href="user.htm">user</a>, “normally <a href="use.htm">use</a>d” refers to a typical or common <a href="use.htm">use</a> of that class of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t, regardless of the <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>us of the <a href="part.htm">part</a>icular <a href="user.htm">user</a> or of the way in which the <a href="part.htm">part</a>icular <a href="user.htm">user</a> actually <a href="use.htm">use</a>s, or expects or is expected to <a href="use.htm">use</a>, the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.&nbsp;&nbsp;A <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is a consumer <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t regardless of whether the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer <a href="use.htm">use</a>s, unless such <a href="use.htm">use</a>s represent the only significant <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>e of <a href="use.htm">use</a> of the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
“<a href="install.htm">Install</a>ation Information” for a <a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t means any methods, procedures, authorization <a href="key.htm">key</a>s, or other information required to <a href="install.htm">install</a> and execute <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified versions of a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> in that <a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t from a <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified version of its Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ification has been made.<br/>
<br/>
If you convey an <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code <a href="work.htm">work</a> under this <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion in, or with, or specifically for <a href="use.htm">use</a> in, a <a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t, and the conveying occurs as <a href="part.htm">part</a> of a transaction in which the right of possession and <a href="use.htm">use</a> of the <a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term <small>(regardless of how the transaction is characterized)</small>, the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e conveyed under this <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion must be accompanied by the <a href="install.htm">Install</a>ation Information.&nbsp;&nbsp;But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third <a href="part.htm">part</a>y retains the ability to <a href="install.htm">install</a> <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ect code on the <a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t <small>(for example, the <a href="work.htm">work</a> has been <a href="install.htm">install</a>ed in ROM)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
The requirement to provide <a href="install.htm">Install</a>ation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a <a href="work.htm">work</a> that has been <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified or <a href="install.htm">install</a>ed by the recipient, or for the <a href="user.htm">User</a> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t in which it has been <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified or <a href="install.htm">install</a>ed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Access to a <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> may be denied when the <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e conveyed, and <a href="install.htm">Install</a>ation Information provided, in accord with this <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion must be in a format that is publicly documented <small>(and with an implementation available to the public in <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e code form)</small>, and must require no special <a href="pass.htm">pass</a>word or <a href="key.htm">key</a> for un<a href="pack.htm">pack</a>ing, reading or copying.<br/>
7. Additional Terms.<br/>
<br/>
“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this Contract by <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty shall be treated as though they were included in this Contract, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.&nbsp;&nbsp;If additional permissions apply only to <a href="part.htm">part</a> of the <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty, that <a href="part.htm">part</a> may be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d separately under those permissions, but the entire <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty remains governed by this Contract without regard to the additional permissions.<br/>
<br/>
When you convey a copy of a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any <a href="part.htm">part</a> of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>(Additional permissions may be written to require their <a href="own.htm">own</a> removal in certain cases when you <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify the <a href="work.htm">work</a>.)</small> You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, for which you have or can give ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riate copyright permission.<br/>
<br/>
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Contract, for material you add to a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, you may <small>(if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)</small> supplement the terms of this Contract with terms:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * a)</small> Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a>ly from the terms of <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ions 15 and 16 of this Contract; or<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * b)</small> Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riate Legal Notices displayed by <a href="work.htm">work</a>s containing it; or<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * c)</small> Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> from the original version; or<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * d)</small> Limiting the <a href="use.htm">use</a> for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * e)</small> Declining to grant rights under <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>emark law for <a href="use.htm">use</a> of some <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e names, <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>emarks, or service marks; or<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * f)</small> Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material <small>(or <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ified versions of it)</small> with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.<br/>
<br/>
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty as you received it, or any <a href="part.htm">part</a> of it, contains a notice <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ing that it is governed by this Contract along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a contract document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this Contract, you may add to a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> material governed by the terms of that contract document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br/>
<br/>
If you add terms to a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> in accord with this <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion, you must place, in the relevant <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="file.htm">file</a>s, a <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ement of the additional terms that apply to those <a href="file.htm">file</a>s, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.<br/>
<br/>
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ed in the form of a separately written contract, or <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ed as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.<br/>
8. Termination.<br/>
<br/>
You may not <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agate or <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> except as expressly provided under this Contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any attempt otherwise to <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agate or <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this Contract <small>(including any patent contracts granted under the third paragraph of <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 11)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
However, if you cease all violation of this Contract, then your contract from a <a href="part.htm">part</a>icular copyright holder is rein<a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ed <small>(a)</small> provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your contract, and <small>(b)</small> permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br/>
<br/>
Moreover, your contract from a <a href="part.htm">part</a>icular copyright holder is rein<a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ed permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this Contract <small>(for any <a href="work.htm">work</a>)</small> from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.<br/>
<br/>
Termination of your rights under this <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion does not terminate the contracts of <a href="part.htm">part</a>ies who have received copies or rights from you under this Contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;If your rights have been terminated and not permanently rein<a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ed, you do not qualify to receive <a href="new.htm">new</a> contracts for the same material under <a href="sect.htm">sect</a>ion 10.<br/>
9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br/>
<br/>
You are not required to accept this Contract in order to receive or run a copy of the <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ancillary <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agation of a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> oc<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ing solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, nothing other than this Contract grants you permission to <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agate or <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify any covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this Contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, by <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ifying or <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agating a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, you indicate your acceptance of this Contract to do so.<br/>
10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br/>
<br/>
Each time you convey a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, the recipient automatically receives a contract from the original licensors, to run, <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify and <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agate that <a href="work.htm">work</a>, subject to this Contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third <a href="part.htm">part</a>ies with this Contract.<br/>
<br/>
An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;If <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agation of a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> results from an entity transaction, each <a href="part.htm">part</a>y to that transaction who receives a copy of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> also receives whatever contracts to the <a href="work.htm">work</a> the <a href="part.htm">part</a>y's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br/>
<br/>
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this Contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, you may not impose a contract fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this Contract, and you may not initiate litigation <small>(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)</small> alleging that any patent claim is infringed by <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty or any portion of it.<br/>
11. Patents.<br/>
<br/>
A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes <a href="use.htm">use</a> under this Contract of the <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty or a <a href="work.htm">work</a> on which the <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty is based.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="work.htm">work</a> thus contractd is called the contributor's “contributor version”.<br/>
<br/>
A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this Contract, of <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>ing, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ification of the contributor version.&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent subcontracts in a manner consistent with the requirements of this Contract.<br/>
<br/>
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-<a href="free.htm">free</a> patent contract under the contributor's essential patent claims, to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e, <a href="use.htm">use</a>, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify and <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agate the contents of its contributor version.<br/>
<br/>
In the following three paragraphs, a “patent contract” is any express <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent <small>(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;To “grant” such a patent contract to a <a href="part.htm">part</a>y means to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e such an <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment or commitment not to enforce a patent against the <a href="part.htm">part</a>y.<br/>
<br/>
If you convey a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, <a href="know.htm">know</a>ingly relying on a patent contract, and the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e of the <a href="work.htm">work</a> is not available for anyone to copy, <a href="free.htm">free</a> of charge and under the terms of this Contract, through a publicly available <a href="net.htm">net</a><a href="work.htm">work</a> server or other readily accessible means, then you must either <small>(1)</small> cause the Corresponding <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e to be so available, or <small>(2)</small> arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent contract for this <a href="part.htm">part</a>icular <a href="work.htm">work</a>, or <small>(3)</small> arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this Contract, to extend the patent contract to downstream recipients.&nbsp;&nbsp;“<a href="know.htm">Know</a>ingly relying” means you have actual <a href="know.htm">know</a>ledge that, but for the patent contract, your conveying the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> in a country, or your recipient's <a href="use.htm">use</a> of the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> in a country, would infringe one or more <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>ntifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br/>
<br/>
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agate by procuring conveyance of, a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and grant a patent contract to some of the <a href="part.htm">part</a>ies receiving the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> authorizing them to <a href="use.htm">use</a>, <a href="prop.htm">prop</a>agate, <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>ify or convey a specific copy of the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, then the patent contract you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> and <a href="work.htm">work</a>s based on it.<br/>
<br/>
A patent contract is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this Contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may not convey a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> if you are a <a href="part.htm">part</a>y to an arrangement with a third <a href="part.htm">part</a>y that is in the business of distributing software, under which you <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ment to the third <a href="part.htm">part</a>y based on the extent of your activity of conveying the <a href="work.htm">work</a>, and under which the third <a href="part.htm">part</a>y grants, to any of the <a href="part.htm">part</a>ies who would receive the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> from you, a discriminatory patent contract <small>(a)</small> in connection with copies of the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> conveyed by you <small>(or copies made from those copies)</small>, or <small>(b)</small> primarily for and in connection with specific <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts or compilations that contain the covered <a href="work.htm">work</a>, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent contract was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing in this Contract shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied contract or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br/>
<br/>
12. No Surrender of Others' <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom.<br/>
<br/>
If conditions are imposed on you <small>(whether by court order, <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>ment or otherwise)</small> that con<a href="trad.htm">trad</a>ict the conditions of this Contract, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this Contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you cannot convey a covered <a href="work.htm">work</a> so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this Contract and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if you <a href="agree.htm">agree</a> to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this Contract would be to refrain entirely from conveying the <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
13. <a href="use.htm">Use</a> with other contracts.<br/>
<br/>
14. Revised Versions of this Contract.<br/>
<br/>
The Personal Sovereignty Foundation may publish revised and/or <a href="new.htm">new</a> versions of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public law.htm">General Public Law</a> from time to time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such <a href="new.htm">new</a> versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>er in detail to address <a href="new.htm">new</a> problems or concerns.<br/>
<br/>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty specifies that a certain numbered version of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public law.htm">General Public Law</a> “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Personal Sovereignty Foundation.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty does not specify a version number of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public law.htm">General Public Law</a>, you may choose any version ever published by the Personal Sovereignty Foundation.<br/>
<br/>
If the <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the <a href="gnu.htm">GNU</a> <a href="general public law.htm">General Public Law</a> can be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d, that proxy's public <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>ement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty.<br/>
<br/>
Later contract versions may give you additional or <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>e<a href="rent.htm">rent</a> permissions.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.<br/>

How to Apply These Terms to Your <a href="new.htm">New</a> <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>tys<br/>
<br/>
If you develop a <a href="new.htm">new</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty, and you want it to be of the greatest possible <a href="use.htm">use</a> to the public, the best way to achieve this is to <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e it <a href="free.htm">free</a> software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br/>
<br/>
To do so, attach the following notices to the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty. It is safest to attach them to the <a href="start.htm">start</a> of each <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>e <a href="file.htm">file</a> to most effectively <a href="stat.htm">stat</a>e the exclusion of warranty; and each <a href="file.htm">file</a> should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;one line to give the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty's name and a brief <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a of what it does.><br/>

<br/>
At the point of sale, the <a href="part.htm">part</a> normally called `<a href="profit.htm">profit</a>' is offered to the <a href="user.htm">User</a> as an investment in his name toward the physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es such as <a href="land.htm">land</a>, tools, <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>dings and plants which will be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d to create more <a href="obj.htm">obj</a>ects.<br/>
<br/>
In this way every <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect <a href="user.htm">User</a> becomes a competitor in <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion to every other <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ect <a href="user.htm">User</a> while jointly <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion with those same <a href="user.htm">user</a>s.<br/>
