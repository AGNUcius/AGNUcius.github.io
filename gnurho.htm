The <a href="gnurho.htm">GNUrho</a> is a <a href="title.htm">Title</a> of <a href="insur.htm">Insur</a>ance for some quality and quantity of good or service within some time-frame.<br/>
<br/>
The projected quality and rate of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion is not guaranteed, but is determined by the validity of the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es that '<a href="back.htm">back</a>' these <a href="title.htm">title</a>s:<br/>

1. Commitments of the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion required to create that <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t.<br/>

&nbsp;This is a % of <a href="real.htm">real</a> and 'secessionable' <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership which any subgroup can fork from the group for any reason <small>(constrained by minimum <a href="real.htm">real</a>istic divisibility)</small>.<br/>

As a <a href="work.htm">work</a>er, you may choose to sign such contracts for anyone willing to accept your expertise.&nbsp;&nbsp;These commitments are <a href="real.htm">real</a> investments.<br/>
<br/>
Other investments are commitments of <a href="land.htm">Land</a> or Capital, or whenever you <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> within the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <a href="arena.htm">Arena</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As an Inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>, you recieve full or <a href="part.htm">part</a>ial <a href="gnurho.htm">GNUrho</a> <a href="title.htm">Title</a>s as a combination of:<br/>
<br/>
1. Some % of <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership in the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion for which you need the outputs.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, someone who drinks milk would want <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in cattle; someone who <a href="use.htm">use</a>s honey would want <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in bees.<br/>
<br/>
2. Commitments from other <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers within the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <a href="arena.htm">Arena</a> to supply the labor needed to operate those Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion on your behalf.&nbsp;&nbsp;While you are fixing cars or <a href="paint.htm">paint</a>ing <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>dings, those with which you have Swapped <a href="skill.htm">Skill</a>s will be milking cows and gathering honey.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This gives us time to solve the "Simultaneous Coincidence of Wants" problem that faces typical barter, and nearly eliminates the need to <a href="use.htm">use</a> <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y at all, since the goods and services we need are already the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of those who need them.<br/>
<br/>
Each <a href="work.htm">work</a>er declares the conditions<br/>
<br/>
<a href="co-own.htm">Co-own</a>ers should advertise minimum allowable standards to avoid attracting <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers unwilling to meet those constraints.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Each <a href="gnurho.htm">GNUrho</a> represents all *potential* <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion of those Physical assets, and so is much more powerful/valuable than a typical <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency.<br/>
<br/>
It might be <a href="use.htm">use</a>ful to also issue 'tickets' against future <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>outs that would more closely resemble typical <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency.<br/>
<br/>
Each ticket has a window of validity - where it could not be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d before some certain time, nor could it be <a href="use.htm">use</a>d after some other certain time.<br/>
<br/>
For example, a group might issue a book of 52 tickets each year for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts that are <a href="use.htm">use</a>d weekly.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="ide.htm">Ide</a>ally this will all be electronic and we will simply carry a card or <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>ntify ourselves in some other manner to collect the goods and services we already <a href="own.htm">own</a>, and to track that <a href="use.htm">use</a> to disallow cheating.&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>(We must defend ourselves against someone who <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s for 1 gallon of milk per week, but then tries to collect more)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
Each <a href="gnurho.htm">GNUrho</a> should represent the societal need as assessed by <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t <a href="user.htm">user</a>s according to the full <a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e paid - where <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing up to <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> indicates worth, and <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing any a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> over <a href="cost.htm">cost</a> as a desire to grow.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="gnurho.htm">GNUrho</a> are issued in response to any investment type, including when <a href="user.htm">User</a>s <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is accepted from <a href="user.htm">User</a>s during the sale of surplus and is then offered <a href="back.htm">back</a> to that same <a href="user.htm">User</a> as shares of <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership in the growth of that group.<br/>
<br/>
These <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ers of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> become new inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s in the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion in exactly the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> they <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This distributes control to those willing to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for that growth as shares of divisible <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the physical <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>es required for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion - so <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts become <a href="free.htm">Free</a> <small>(as in <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom)</small> for every <a href="user.htm">User</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="gnurho.htm">GNUrho</a> is bound by the conditions of the <a href="iota.htm">IOTA</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A functional <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <a href="arena.htm">Arena</a> will require a minimum "Horizontal Diversity" to allow us to '<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>' each other without needing to <a href="pass.htm">pass</a> tokens.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, we buy/<a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d a dentist office and the tools for simple dental procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;We must attract or train someone that can operate those tools, and who is willing to commit to do that <a href="work.htm">work</a> for the '<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>' of gaining <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership in the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion for his housing, food, clothing, transportation, sanitation, etc. combined with commitments of others to operate those MoP for his benefit in return for his fixing their teeth.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice this fully replaces <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>itional <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance.<br/>
<br/>
We will also want to <a href="work.htm">work</a> toward "Vertical Integration" to move away from the need to gather and spend external tokens. For example, we will buy grains and alfalfa at first to feed our chickens and cattle, but will also grow those plants to avoid the need to buy in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;Vertical Integration is a very long-term goal, and we won't <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> mines or factories right away, but will just buy tools from China at first, while we are '<a href="boot.htm">boot</a>ing'.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="part.htm">Part</a> of the initial <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s for purchasing the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion might be collected from middle-income consumers who are willing to pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for organic goods.<br/>
<br/>
Each person would invest just enough <small>(either <a href="mone.htm">Mone</a>y, <a href="land.htm">Land</a> or Capital)</small> to cover the predicted <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion for the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t they each intend to <a href="use.htm">use</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Each of these inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s would still need to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> their % of the <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>s as usual, but since they would accept the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t itself as the return for that risk, there would be sale, and so <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> would not exist at all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Labor will come from <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>ed <a href="art.htm">art</a>isans initially willing to <a href="work.htm">work</a> in return for food, shelter, basic medical care, etc. with a future <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>out of <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership in the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion <a href="arena.htm">Arena</a>.<br/>
<br/>
These <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers must receive <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership in the MoP for which they need the outputs, but until those facilities are functional, will need to be paid more 'directly' by being housed in tents and fed basic rations, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here is the rough business <a href="mod.htm">mod</a>el:<br/>
----<br/>
1.)</small> <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t is the Inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>'s Return.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means Consumers will micro-invest by pre-<a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing for results, become <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers of that business and receive the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t itself as a side-effect of that <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er's Investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means late-coming Consumers will overpay for <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t as usual, but we will treat <small>(at least some % of)</small> that value as though they had invested as described in #1.<br/>
<br/>
3.)</small> Investments are commitments of Future Labor and Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es. This means we will issue a deposit-based, *<a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ing* <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency <a href="back.htm">back</a>ed by both the <a href="land.htm">land</a> and tools and other inputs, plus the <a href="work.htm">work</a> needed to transform those assets into a <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts are not sold when the <a href="user.htm">User</a>s <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion, because the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is already in the hands of those who will consume it - even before it is <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed.<br/>
<br/>
For example, you do not need to buy Apples when you <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a> an Apple or orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> because you *already* <a href="own.htm">own</a> your % of that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t according to your % of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <small>(trees, <a href="land.htm">land</a>, water-rights, etc.)</small> needed to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e those apples.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers commit to swap <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s before <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion begins, there is no need to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> wages because compensation comes in the form of accepting the <a href="work.htm">work</a> of others on your behalf.<br/>
<br/>
For example, you do not need to be paid to <a href="pic.htm">pic</a>k Oranges when someone else is <a href="pic.htm">pic</a>king Apples for you, and while someone else is <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>ing to fix your teeth, and someone else <a href="promis.htm">promis</a>es to fix your car, etc., because your needs are then already met.<br/>
