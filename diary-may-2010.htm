Subject: On the impossibility of sharing <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ware<br/>
<br/>
Could we ever learn to share the <a href="hard.htm">hard</a>ware needed to host 'regular' server-based <a href="free.htm">Free</a> Software to compete with FaceBook?<br/>
<br/>
I can't seem to find any discussion of that <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>icult step.<br/>
<br/>
I have some <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>as about how to approach the problem, but don't <a href="know.htm">know</a> if this is an ap<a href="prop.htm">prop</a>riate forum for such a discussion?<br/>
<br/>
Even more aggressively I want to talk about how we, the <a href="user.htm">user</a>s, can <a href="own.htm">own</a> and control the entire physical layer to become a <a href="free.htm">Free</a> as in <a href="free.htm">Free</a>dom ISP and cell-phone services, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>as or pointers to groups or lists addressing this subject?<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>

<br/>
There is a deep flaw in our system <small>(raw Capitalism)</small> that <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>es the rich richer and the poor poorer.<br/>
<br/>
This is caused by the Positive Feed<a href="back.htm">back</a> Loop constructed when we treat <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as a reward for the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers instead of understanding it to be a plea for growth from the latecomer who just paid it.<br/>

Bullshit.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich do not want the poor to progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;They want exactly the opposite - for if the poor were to gain the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty needed to get out from under the thumb of those who are 'ahead', then the value called <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> would no longer flow out of those <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers and into the hands of the parasites who subjugate society and purposefully murder our planet to perpetuate the scarcity that <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> requires.<br/>

Either I am misunderstanding you or you are suggesting the rich "ought to get richer" because they are simply superior humans and the poor are poor simply because they are inferior.<br/>

<span class="quot">> It's interesting that you conceptualize it in terms of "<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion":</span><br/>

<span class="quot">> nature as "<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive")</small>.</span><br/>
<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>ts are, of course, the 'results' or 'outputs' of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
For humans, the most <a href="fund.htm">fund</a>amental <small>(cannot do without)</small> <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts are food and medicine which are primarily <small>(and could be solely)</small> aquired from <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive plants and animals.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I talk about "<a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion" is because of the importance of these outputs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you eat breakfast?&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you eat lunch and dinner?&nbsp;&nbsp;Where did those inputs come from?<br/>
<br/>
Most <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion within our <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent system <small>(raw Capitalism)</small> is not done "for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t", but is ignorantly done "for <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>"; and so we face <a href="mount.htm">mount</a>ains of trouble caused by this misdirected effort to keep <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a> which requires scarcity therefore promoting destruction and even war.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion I talk about is "for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t".&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>e without some <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion, for we must consume the outputs of plants and animals and also must repair our shelters and clean our bodies, etc.<br/>
<br/>
We <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ently face a terrible but mostly unspeakable crisis in that we do not <a href="own.htm">own</a> the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of these <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts.<br/>
<br/>
We try to <a href="own.htm">own</a> some of these plants and animals individually, in solitary confinement through gardening and DIY tools etc.<br/>
<br/>
But we haven't yet discovered how to *share* <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion - leaving that to "for <a href="profit.htm">profit</a>" corporations who care nothing of the <a href="use.htm">use</a>-value of those commodities <small>(except for their outward appearance for the purpose of tricking us into purchasing them)</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their only goal is to keep <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>.<br/>
<br/>
We do not <a href="know.htm">know</a> how to 'scale' any "for <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t" organization primarily because we have been fooled into believing <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> arises as a result of labor, and so almost universally tend to begin with the unquestioned false notion that the <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers should be the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion and that <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> should be treated as their reward.<br/>
<br/>
It is easy to see <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> <small>(the <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between Consumer <a href="pric.htm">Pric</a>e and <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s)</small> is actually a result of the Consumers' lack of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership using the following example:<br/>
<br/>
Let's say a small group of olive-eaters co-buy an olive orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> for their <a href="own.htm">own</a> good.<br/>
<br/>
They must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion, including any Wages, but they do not <small>(and cannot)</small> <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> because they do not *buy* the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t at the end of the season, but <a href="own.htm">own</a> it already - as a sort of "side effect" of their <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
This is true of any and all <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> has nothing to do with <a href="work.htm">Work</a> and has everything to do with Consumer dependence upon the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>e <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ers and so should be treated as an investment from the Consumer who paid it - so he also gains the <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership needed to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> him from those who would otherwise exploit his lack of preparedness.<br/>

Samuel Rose wrote:<br/>
<span class="quot">> What do you mean by "those who paid them"?</span><br/>
<br/>
I mean the persons who paid the value called '<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>'.<br/>
<br/>
The Consumers <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> this value, but in our <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent system they never gain any ground <small>(never acquire <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership)</small> because we misunderstand the origin and therefore the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a> 'destination' of <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> only occurs when a Consumer lacks sufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, when a Consumer <a href="own.htm">own</a>s enough <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es <small>(say the eater of an Avocado is <a href="part.htm">part</a> <a href="own.htm">own</a>er in an Avocado tree)</small>, then all <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s must be paid as usual, but <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> cannot be paid since there is no exchange of goods after <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Avocado is neither bought nor sold, but is *already* in the hands of the actor who will consume it and so <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> becomes 'undefined'.<br/>
<br/>
This seems to prove <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> has nothing to do with <a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers hired to <a href="install.htm">install</a>, maintain, <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> or operate, the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
I am not trying to exploit the <a href="work.htm">Work</a>er, I am trying to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> him "from underneath" by helping him <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>d the foundation of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership he needs to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> his ability to Consume instead of pretending <a href="work.htm">Work</a> is a need in itself.<br/>
<br/>
This allows us to let Wages float according to the market <small>(any <a href="work.htm">Work</a>er can reverse-bid for any <a href="job.htm">job</a>)</small> without needing to <a href="prop.htm">prop</a> them up with '<a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ions' such as minimum-wages or labor unions, etc.<br/>
<br/>
It also <a href="free.htm">free</a>s us to utilize automation and robotics as much as we like without ever worrying about putting people "out of <a href="work.htm">work</a>" since we finally have the horse in-front of the cart so that creation is no longer 'destruction' and abundance is no longer a 'problem' and value is not in 'crisis'.<br/>

For a simplified example: If someone who likes olives invests in an olive tree <small>(or co-buys an orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> with some other consumers)</small>, then they must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> all the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion, including any Wages, but do not <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> because they do not *buy* the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t at the end of the season, but <a href="own.htm">own</a> it already - as a sort of "side effect" of their <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion...<br/>
<br/>
Now this may seem like a good arrangement, since the consumer then gets goods "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" and under their full control. And if they have any extra olives, they can still charge <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> against anyone who needs to buy them.<br/>
<br/>
But the problem occurs when everyone on earth invests in this selfish manner - for then *nobody* will need to buy olives, but will instead be getting them "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" causing <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> in that field to approach zero.<br/>
<br/>
How will we <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e sure inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s always target <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion for which they have no interest in the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts thereof so <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> will continue to flow?<br/>

<br/>
I'm not exactly sure what you mean, but will try to answer meaningfully.<br/>
<br/>
Today society we have a parasitic arrangement where massive <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers of Capital are Consumers but do no valuable <a href="work.htm">work</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are the true bums of our society.<br/>
<br/>
In a better world, every consumer will be a <a href="work.htm">work</a>er in some manner.<br/>
<br/>
And of course we already <a href="know.htm">know</a> every <a href="work.htm">work</a>er is the a consumer of *something*, for nobody can <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>e without food and water and probably shelter and sanitation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1.)</small> One reason a consumer may not be the <a href="work.htm">work</a>er for the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t he needs is because of "variance in <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>".<br/>
For example, even if they have access to all the tools, most people cannot troubleshoot and fix problems with diesel engines.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> Another reason a Consumer may not be the <a href="work.htm">Work</a>er for the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t he needs is because of "need of help".<br/>
For example, even if they have access to all the tools, *nobody* can perform brain-surgery upon themselves.<br/>
<br/>
3.)</small> Another reason a Consumer may not be the <a href="work.htm">Work</a>er for the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t he needs is because it "improves efficiency".<br/>
For example, even if they have access to all the tools, it is valuable to have someone else cook for an entire neighborhood while I am out shoveling manure and others are programming <a href="compu.htm">compu</a>ters, and others are fixing teeth, etc.<br/>

<br/>
I <a href="agree.htm">agree</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;We need <a href="land.htm">Land</a>, Capital, and Labor <small>(by 'Capital' I primarily mean Tools, <a href="buil.htm">Buil</a>dings, Energy, and all other inputs of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion)</small>.<br/>

<span class="quot">> of that <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a would be an arcology where all members are <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers,</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> consumers, and <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers. Like a cruise ship or Disney<a href="land.htm">land</a>.</span><br/>
<br/>
Yes, Let's <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e an "Everything <a href="work.htm">Work</a>shop" where you can <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> tools to <a href="work.htm">work</a> on cars, <a href="mak.htm">mak</a>e furniture, <a href="use.htm">use</a> large washing <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hines and expensive/heavy-duty sewing <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hines, and get all of your meals "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>".<br/>
<br/>
If nobody else is trying to <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> the <a href="mac.htm">mac</a>hine when you want it, then it will be available "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>".<br/>
<br/>
But if there is a scheduling conflict - if someone else want it at the same time - then you will bid against each other.<br/>
<br/>
The winner of that auction will be <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing a "<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" <small>(<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
We will treat that overpayment as HIS investment toward the purchase of yet *another* instance of that type of tool since the fact there was a conflict proves there were an insufficient number of instances needed to meet peak demand...<br/>
<br/>
On the other side of this, as <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers of those tools begin to neglect their upkeep <small>(because they no longer care about them)</small>, then those who <a href="rent.htm">rent</a> - even when just <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing maintenance - should probably incrementally become the <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ent <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ers ... but this is a delicate matter that I have not fully explored.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yes, we would charge "<a href="pric.htm">pric</a>e above <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>" <small>(<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>)</small> against those who do not yet have sufficient <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership to <a href="protect.htm">protect</a> themselves from it, but would then treat that overpayment as an *investment* from the very same person who paid it.<br/>
<br/>
Treating <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> as <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er Investment is a "Negative Feed<a href="back.htm">back</a> Loop" that causes those latecomers to incrementally gain their <a href="own.htm">own</a> <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty which means they eventually will also receive all goods and services "at <a href="cost.htm">cost</a>".<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span class="quot">> Also, all sweat equity is not created equal, so this is a serious</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> issue. Valuable <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers perhaps could <a href="work.htm">work</a> less hours, but that would</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> probably seem unfair. Unless people are only admitted members if they</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> fall within a certain sweat equity value range. Which seems to</span><br/>
<span class="quot">> exclusive, subjective, and conformist.</span><br/>
<br/>
There is something wrong with the <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>a that <a href="work.htm">work</a> and time are <a href="ide.htm">ide</a>ntical.<br/>
<br/>
One example of the trouble it causes is how it incents <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers to 'milk' an occupation - to drag-out the solution because to complete the <a href="job.htm">job</a> early becomes a punishment!<br/>
<br/>
We want to incent the automation and the elimination of drudgery.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a> is not a need in itself, it is a hurdle on our road to success!<br/>
<br/>
We should reward clever solutions that destroy <a href="job.htm">job</a>s.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are carrying water in buckets <small>(metaphorically)</small>, we want the "young whipersnapper" to feel safe enough to say "maybe we should lay some pipe".<br/>
