<br/>
A group can supply all the inputs for all the outputs they need.<br/>
<br/>
Inputs are <a href="work.htm">work</a>, <a href="land.htm">land</a>, water, organisms, tools, energy, etc.<br/>
Outputs are food, housing, clothing, sanitation, transport, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Some inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y as inputs now and receive outputs later.<br/>
For example 1,000 milk drinkers <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> $1,000 each to buy a dairy.<br/>
These inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s receive milk some time after <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion has begun.<br/>
<br/>
Some inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> labor as inputs later and receive outputs now.<br/>
For example 10 <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers commit to all the labor to run the dairy.<br/>
These inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>s receive many outputs before <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion has begun.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers need outputs now because that is all they receive in wages.<br/>
They need food, housing, clothing, sanitation, transport, etc.<br/>
<br/>
But how will we supply the outputs before they have been <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ed?<br/>
<br/>
Output consumers are input <a href="own.htm">own</a>ers.<br/>
<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t is the Inve<a href="stor.htm">stor</a>'s Return.<br/>
<a href="work.htm">Work</a> is another Investment type.<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er's Investment.<br/>
Secession divides <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
SUMMARY<br/>
1.)</small> The <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>t is never sold <small>(except surplus as defined in #3)</small> because each <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>er has spread their investments across all the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion for which they predict they will need the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects, and in just enough to receive the a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> the need.&nbsp;&nbsp;This eliminates <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> because the final transaction does not occur.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is <a href="know.htm">know</a>n as <a href="econ.htm">econ</a>omic <a href="imput.htm">imput</a>ation.<br/>
<br/>
2.)</small> A <a href="promis.htm">Promis</a>e-to-<a href="work.htm">work</a> is an Investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means middle-to-lower income Consumers will prepay <small>(think a variant of crowd <a href="sourc.htm">sourc</a>ing mixed with scheduled time-<a href="bank.htm">bank</a>ing)</small> by committing to <a href="work.htm">work</a> in the future in return for <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership in the <a href="vipm.htm">VIPM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
3.)</small> <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is the <a href="pay.htm">Pay</a>er's Investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means we will charge <a href="profit.htm">profit</a> against those who buy surplus <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects, but treat <small>(at least some % of)</small> as an Investment in more Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es that will finally vest to the Consumer who paid it so that every Consumer incrementally gains <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership in the Physical <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es needed to <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>e all the <a href="obj.htm">Obj</a>ects they need.<br/>
<br/>
4.)</small> Secession is a <a href="protect.htm">protect</a>ed right.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means any subgroup may secede for any arbitrary reason while retaining their portion of of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership that <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an attempt to address the Tyranny of the Majority.<br/>

Member:&nbsp;&nbsp;One <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>er of <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es within a Crowd.<br/>
NON-Member: Any person with insufficient <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership in <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es and so must resort to buying <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t and <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>ing <a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>.<br/>
<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a href="diff.htm">diff</a>erence between what the <a href="own.htm">Own</a>er paid in <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s and what the Consumer <a href="pay.htm">pay</a>s at the point-of-sale.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="profit.htm">Profit</a> is undefined when the Consumer of the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t has sufficient <a href="part.htm">part</a> <a href="own.htm">Own</a>ership in the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es, because, in that case, they <a href="own.htm">own</a> the <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t already, as a side-effect of <a href="own.htm">own</a>ing the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Consumer/<a href="own.htm">Own</a>er must <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> the <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion or slowly loose <a href="co-own.htm">co-own</a>ership as the Crowd sells some of those <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es to <a href="pay.htm">pay</a> for the re<a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ing <a href="cost.htm">Cost</a>s.<br/>

<a href="work.htm">Work</a>ers on-site during <a href="boot.htm">BOOT</a>UP are offered tents or movable <a href="buil.htm">buil</a>dings for shelter and cafeteria meals from bulk-food purchases.<br/>

Issue "<a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t Futures" at that scale.<br/>
Most middle-to-upper class consumers will buy <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t Futures with plain old <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y.<br/>
Most lower-to-middle class consumers will buy <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>t Futures with <a href="work.htm">work</a> bonds <small>(commitments to <a href="work.htm">work</a> in the future)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
PHASE 1:<br/>
<a href="imag.htm">Imag</a>ine a community or village with enough <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tive complexity to provide a 'reasonable' standard of <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>ing for all those who <a href="work.htm">work</a> and <a href="liv.htm">liv</a>e there.<br/>
<br/>
So there is an orc<a href="hard.htm">hard</a> and a dairy and a bakery and a dentist office, etc.<br/>
<br/>
But the distribution of <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty <a href="own.htm">own</a>ership in this community is very strange compared to most:<br/>
<br/>
The bakery is <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by the subgroup that wants bread instead of being <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by the bakers.<br/>
And the dairy is <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by the subgroup that wants milk instead of being <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by the milkers.<br/>
And the water is <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by the subgroup that wants water instead of being <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by the water-<a href="work.htm">work</a>ers.<br/>
And the beehives are <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by the subgroup that wants honey instead of being <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by the beekeepers.<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
This causes the <a href="produc.htm">PRODUC</a>TS of these industries to be 'pre-distributed' <small>(already <a href="own.htm">own</a>ed by)</small> those who will finally consume them.  This means there is no need to buy/sell the <a href="produc.htm">PRODUC</a>T because it is already the <a href="proper.htm">proper</a>ty of those who need it.<br/>
<br/>
This assumes each consumer <a href="own.htm">own</a>s the *perfect* a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of shares in each industry to receive the *exact* a<a href="mount.htm">mount</a> of <a href="produc.htm">PRODUC</a>T they predicted they would need *and* that their prediction was perfect, *and* that the quantity and quality of the projected <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion was perfectly accurate.<br/>
<br/>
I <a href="know.htm">know</a> how to solve each of those problems, but will save that for a later <a href="mail.htm">mail</a>.  I only bring it up now to avoid concentrating on it.<br/>
<br/>
The other major issue I will cover in a future <a href="mail.htm">mail</a> is how the <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers can "swap <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s" in an efficient manner <small>(hint: by committing to those tasks *before* <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion begins)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
When <a href="use.htm">use</a>d in combination, these constraints create a <a href="real.htm">real</a> <a href="insur.htm">insur</a>ance for any industry and allows <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers to specialize without excessive token-<a href="pass.htm">pass</a>ing <small>(the need to <a href="use.htm">use</a> of <a href="mone.htm">mone</a>y is greatly reduced)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sufficiently diverse groups of <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers can meet their basic needs if they <a href="own.htm">own</a> the <a href="sourc.htm">Sourc</a>es and <a href="skill.htm">Skill</a>s needed for that <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
A group of 100 to 1000 diversely <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>ed <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers on 100 - 1000 acres could do this with access to the Means of <a href="produc.htm">Produc</a>tion.<br/>
<br/>
There is milk and honey where there are cattle and bees.<br/>
But only if <a href="work.htm">work</a>ers can <a href="trad.htm">trad</a>e <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s between themselves.<br/>
<br/>
As groups cluster, they can <a href="own.htm">own</a> and operate the entire vertically integrated chain <small>(actually tree)</small> of <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>tion for all the <a href="produc.htm">produc</a>ts they want.<br/>
<br/>
We can help this groups cluster and swap <a href="skill.htm">skill</a>s.<br/>
The further we scale, the closer we approach autonomy.<br/>
<br/>
You can think of these as legally-binding Commitments of <a href="proper.htm">Proper</a>ty <small>(as the <a href="land.htm">land</a> and tools, etc.)</small> and <a href="promis.htm">Promis</a>es <small>(as labor)</small>.<br/>
<br/>
These commitments can be represented with the <a href="gnurho.htm">GNUrho</a> or <a href="iota.htm">IOTA</a> <a href="curr.htm">curr</a>ency.<br/>
